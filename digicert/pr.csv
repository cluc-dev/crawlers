"<p>March 7, 2007 -- In a combined effort with Microsoft, DigiCert is excited to introduce the new DigiCert Unified Communications UCC Certificate.  UC certificates are sometimes called SAN Certificates, because they use Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to secure up to 25 different fully qualified domain names.  They are designed to work with the new Microsoft Unified Communications server.  In addition, <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/multi-domain-ssl.htm"">UCC Certificates</a> are an excellent solution for server administrators who wish to secure many different domain names with the same certificate.

            January 5, 2009 -- On December 30, 2008 a group of security researchers reported that by exploiting a known weakness in the MD5 hashing algorithm, they were able to create a rogue intermediate CA certificate under the ""Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1"" root certificate, belonging to GeoTrust's RapidSSL brand.
        </p>,<p>
            Because all certificates issued by DigiCert use the SHA-1 standard, we are happy to reassure all our past, present, and future customers that these findings do not present any reason for them to worry about the integrity of their DigiCert SSL certificates.
            The fact that DigiCert uses SHA-1 instead of the outdated MD5, along with various other internal controls, makes the attack by <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/#sec5"" target=""blank"">the MD5 researchers</a> impossible.
	</p>,<p>The recent findings also highlight the problems inherent in the practice of issuing domain validated certificates, which can be issued automatically, with no human element in the verification process.
	
	Though frequently the companies that issue these ""rapid,"" ""instant,"" ""low assurance,"" or ""automated"" certificates tout the speed with which SSL certificates can be issued, these certificates provide no assurance that the certificate belongs to a real company.</p>,<p>To protect our customers, DigiCert issues only organization-validated, high assurance SSL certificates.  This, in addition to other security practices, helps to prevent phishing and other abuses.</p>,<p>Netcraft, an internet services and security company, reported the following in <a href=""http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/01/01/14_of_ssl_certificates_signed_using_vulnerable_md5_algorithm.html"" target=""blank"">addressing the issue</a>:
		</p>,<p>""The researchers have noted that certificates for <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">Extended Validation (EV) SSL</a> websites cannot be faked in this way - because the EV standard requires SHA1 or better signatures, and indeed there are no MD5-signed EV certificates found by our survey. 
			This shows that requiring minimum standards from the CAs can have positive effects - hopefully browser vendors will take note, and start requiring that CAs apply similar minimum standards to other certificates.""

"<p>LINDON, UT (September 17, 2008) — DigiCert, Inc., the most trusted provider of enterprise-class high-assurance SSL certificates, has expanded its industry-leading line of SSL certificate encryption and authentication products to provide greater flexibility, compatibility and simplicity for SSL security certificate managers with an affordable and easy-to-manage solution. </p>,<p>Two enhanced products – Unified Communications Certificate and WildCard Plus – offer unprecedented dynamic security for multiple server names and expand platform compatibility, and two new CSR Command Generators help customers cut through the cumbersome technical components of SSL management. </p>,<p>“We have built an exemplary reputation for providing very strong 256-bit SSL certificates to some of the most recognized and demanding organizations in the world, from Fortune 500 companies to national and state governments and educational and medical institutions,” said Ken Bretschneider, CEO of DigiCert, Inc. “These new products and tools reflect our passion for providing our customers with solutions to make the SSL environment easier to manage, with the same outstanding security they’ve come to expect.”</p>,<p><strong>Unified Communications (UC) Certificate</strong></p>,<p>DigiCert’s UC, or SAN, Certificate provides unlimited server license to secure multiple servers with a user-controlled Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field to include up to 25 SANs in one certificate, even if host names are on different domains. Designed specifically for Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Office Communications Server 2007, but compatible with any platform, DigiCert’s UC Certificates cost as little as $262 per year for four server names. Requesting a UC certificate is made easier by DigiCert’s exclusive <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/easy-csr/exchange2007.htm"">CSR Command Generator for Exchange</a>, a free web-based application that eliminates the need to learn Exchange's New-ExchangeCertificate command and its confusing syntax.</p>,<p>“The Unified Communications SAN Certificate allows you to run all services on one IP address, significantly reducing the complexity of server configuration,” DigiCert CTO Paul Tiemann said. “It’s simple to add and remove SANs with our online certificate management tools and much easier to maintain than putting multiple IP addresses on your server and assigning a different certificate to each one. It’s also much cheaper – you pay only for the names you use, whether it's four or 25, with no ‘gotcha’ or hidden fees.”</p>,<p><strong>Wildcard Plus</strong></p>,<p>Designed for system administrators managing multiple subdomains or multiple servers, a DigiCert WildCard Plus certificate eliminates maintenance headaches and saves valuable time and cost typically associated with managing multiple certificates with varying expiration dates. WildCard Plus provides security for an entire domain (*.example.com), including www.example.com, mail.example.com and any other first-level subdomain; it even includes the base domain -- example.com – something traditional wildcard products do not offer.</p>,<p>DigiCert’s WildCard Plus also enhances mobile device compatibility by using the SAN field to overcome syntax errors related to the requisite asterisk (*) character in most wildcard certificates. While some mobile clients, including Windows Mobile 5, do not support the asterisk (*) for wildcard name matching, they do support SANs. DigiCert’s WildCard Plus resolves the syntax error by allow the addition of up to 10 specific subdomains. </p>,<p>“By adding the wildcard and the mail server name, for example, to the same certificate, mobile devices can now accept the specific host name,” Bretschneider said. “And because this is done with our Unlimited Server License, you can issue multiple certificates for as many subdomains as you need. Those ten additional subdomains are per certificate, so the Unlimited Server License essentially makes this unlimited, too. In the past, the only option was to add separate SSL Certificates. We’ve had many large clients save thousands of dollars with a WildCard Plus certificate, versus managing multiple certificates individually.” </p>,<p><strong>Easy CSR Command Generators</strong></p>,<p>DigiCert's Easy CSR Command Generators are free web-based tools designed to simplify the certificate signing request process for <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/easy-csr/openssl.htm"">generating CSRs in OpenSSL</a> and MS Exchange and eliminate the need to memorize cumbersome technical syntax. These tools enable certificate managers to compile the command using pre-defined fields and then generate the command code to embed into their server.</p>,<p>“The CSR Command Generators are truly unique tools in the industry,” said Jeff Snider, DigiCert's Director of Web Development. “Managing SSL certificates can be a complicated technical process, and we’re committed to making it as simple as possible and to providing the most value to our customers. These free tools are designed specifically to do just that.”</p>,<p>DigiCert offers a 30-day trial period for all SSL certificate products and provides a full 100% money-back guarantee.

			DigiCert certificates can be used with the SafeMashups MashSSL Web ToolKit to protect emerging Web 2.0 protocols that require applications to build a trusted pipe to each other while 
			communicating through a third party user.
		</p>,<p>
			""The recent session fixation vulnerability discovered in OAuth is a perfect example of the sort of vulnerabilities that arise when two web services have to communicate via a potentially 
			untrusted user"", said Ravi Ganesan, Founder and CEO, SafeMashups Inc. ""We are pleased to partner with a market leader like DigiCert to spur on the adoption of the emerging MashSSL standard,
			the use of which is a quick way to solve this problem without using a new proprietary cryptographic protocol or requiring a new trust infrastructure.""
		</p>,<p>			
			Because DigiCert Root Certificates will be supported within the SafeMashups Community Service (SCS) and the MashSSL Web ToolKit, DigiCert will be able to offer certificates to MashSSL 
			community members upon request.  MashSSL compatible certificates issued by DigiCert can be used with the royalty-free MashSSL Web Toolkit to create a trusted pipe between web services 
			communicating through a user's browser.  
		</p>,<p>			
			""The lack of a standard and secure approach to building a trusted pipe between your web service and that of your business partners through a potentially untrusted user is a common problem 
			that the innovative MashSSL technology protects against,"" explained Christopher Skarda, DigiCert's Vice President of Operations.  ""What is most interesting about MashSSL is that it requires
			no changes in the underlying protocol, and there is no end user impact. For instance, web services using OAuth can establish a MashSSL session and then simply use their existing OAuth 
			implementation without any changes to that protocol, or any changes to the browser.""
		</p>,<p>			
			DigiCert and SafeMashups have both reiterated their commitment to working through the standards process with other partners to make the MashSSL specification an open standard.

			LINDON, UT (December 16, 2010) — <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/"">DigiCert, Inc</a>., a leading provider of Authentication &amp; Encryption services, is the first Certificate Authority to offer an EV SSL Wildcard alternative. Organizations can now choose a package of 3, 10, or 25 EV SSL certificates to secure an entire domain name as they would with a traditional wildcard certificate.
		</p>,<p>
			<a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">DigiCert’s EV SSL certificates</a> confirm that websites have passed rigorous identity verification procedures through special indicators easily visible on the browser address bar. Using EV certificates gives visitors visual confirmation of the site’s legitimacy, helps to preserve brand reputation, and helps to protect site owners from phishing and online fraud. With this instant visual assurance, users have increased trust in the site owner and more confidence when submitting their data, which often leads to higher site conversions.
		</p>,<p>			
			While standard EV SSL certificates only secure a single name, DigiCert’s new <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.htm"">Wildcard</a> package offers the flexibility of a wildcard combined with the high-assurance security of EV SSL. Customers can choose a package of 3, 10, or 25 EV SSL certificates with a 1- or 2-year lifetime. All of the certificates in the package will have the same expiration date and can be used all at once or as needed over the term lifetime.
		</p>,<p>			
			The certificates in the EV Wildcard package are issued to the same base domain. With this new product, server administrators can deploy multiple EV SSL certificates across their domain similar to a traditional wildcard certificate. This makes it possible to secure an entire domain at the EV level at a much lower cost than any other option available today.
		</p>,<p>			
			“DigiCert’s new EV Wildcard packages are a simple and very affordable option for securing a whole domain with EV SSL,” says Travis Tidball, Vice President of Marketing. “EV is the new standard for encryption and authentication and our EV Wildcard alternative makes it easier to extend the proven benefits of EV to your entire IT infrastructure.”

"<p>LINDON, Utah, Feb. 19 -- On Wednesday, February 18 at the Black Hat conference in Washington, D.C., an independent hacker known as Moxie Marlinspike presented a software tool called SSLstrip designed to remove the SSL protection from websites using advanced man-in-the-middle attack methods. DigiCert, a major worldwide provider of SSL Certificates, replied that Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates help users to recognize and steer clear of such attacks.</p>,<p>Marlinspike demonstrated how the SSLstrip program can intercept connections between a web browser and a trusted website, then serve the web browser the contents of the trusted site without trusted SSL encryption. The webpage could potentially be loaded unsecured (http) or spoofed with a low-assurance SSL certificate on a fraudulent domain name, similar to a phishing attack. Therefore, it is possible that the pages would still load with a padlock in the browser. SSLstrip could potentially be effective at stealing sensitive information including usernames, passwords, or credit card information in situations where man-in-the-middle attacks are possible such as in Onion Routing configurations and Wi-Fi networks.</p>,<p>SSLstrip does not demonstrate a weakness in SSL encryption, but rather takes advantage of users who fail to look for trusted SSL encryption when sending sensitive information over the Internet. This problem has been exacerbated by the use and distribution of low-assurance certificates.</p>,<p>In anticipation of such problems DigiCert joined with the other major Certification Authorities and Browser developers to establish Extended Validation Certificates. EV Certificates are all vetted rigorously to guarantee authenticity of websites and strong encryption. EV certificates are recognized by major web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome. All of these browsers distinguish EV-secured websites by easily identifiable means. For example, the website address bar of Internet Explorer 7 will turn green to certify that the user is connected to an EV-secured website.</p>,<p>""The proper use and recognition of EV certificates effectively resolves the weaknesses exposed by both phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks,"" explained Christopher Skarda, DigiCert's Vice President of Operations. ""In this way, EV certificates help to protect users against identity theft. Also, EV certificates help online companies to establish the trust and protection that their customers have learned to expect.""</p>,<p>EV Certificates from DigiCert:</p>,<p><a href=""https://www.digicert.com/news-archive.htm"">Return to News Archive</a></p>,<p><a href=""https://www.digicert.com/newsroom.htm"">Return to Main News Page</a></p>",https://www.digicert.com/news/2009-02-19-sslstrip-ev.htm,<h1>DigiCert EV SSL Certificates Protect Users From SSLstrip<br>and Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h1>,<h2>SSL Certificate Authority Answers New Digital Threats Presented at Black Hat Conference</h2>

			Phishing is just one of the many ways that the Internet can be used to get people to unknowingly provide their personal financial information to fraudsters. Phishing 
			often targets and leverages the trusted brands of well-known entities like banks, payment services, social networking sites, and other places where users are likely to

		</p>,<p>LINDON, Utah, Feb. 19 -- On Wednesday, February 18 at the Black Hat conference inWashington, D.C., an independent hacker known as Moxie Marlinspike presented a software tool called SSLstrip designed to remove the SSL protection from websites using advanced man-in-the-middle attack methods. DigiCert, a major worldwide provider of SSL Certificates, replied that Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates help users to recognize and steer clear of such attacks.</p>,<p>Marlinspike demonstrated how the SSLstrip program can intercept connections between a web browser and a trusted website, then serve the web browser the contents of the trusted site without trusted SSL encryption. The webpage could potentially be loaded unsecured (http) or spoofed with a low-assurance SSL certificate on a fraudulent domain name, similar to a phishing attack. Therefore, it is possible that the pages would still load with a padlock in the browser. SSLstrip could potentially be effective at stealing sensitive information including usernames, passwords, or credit card information in situations where man-in-the-middle attacks are possible such as in Onion Routing configurations and Wi-Fi networks.  <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/news/2009-02-19-sslstrip-ev.htm"">Read more...</a></p>,<p>February 5, 2009 -- With fraud and identity theft as the top concerns of today's online consumers, Extended Validation (EV) SSL can increase user trust for any online business.</p>,<p>With today's addition of Opera, DigiCert EV certificates are now supported in 100% of EV-enabled browsers.

			Because all certificates issued by DigiCert use the SHA-1 standard, we are happy to reassure all our past, present, and future customers that these findings do not present any reason for them to worry about the integrity of their DigiCert SSL certificates.

		The new ""Plus"" feature means different things for different certificates:</p>,<p>For Single-Name and EV Certificates - All DigiCert Single-Name and EV certificates are now designed to authenticate to the domain name with

		With the new ""Plus"" feature, your Single-Name or EV certificate will work seamlessly, regardless of whether or not your visitors include ""www."" in the URL.</p>,<p>For Wildcard Certificates - The plus feature includes the base domain (""example.com"" in a certificate issued to ""*.example.com""), 
		overcoming a flaw in traditional wildcard certificates.  WildCard Plus also allows for compatibility for Windows Mobile 5, which does not otherwise 
		accept the ""*"" character that is basic to the syntax of Wildcard Certificates.  Server administrators have the ability to include specific subdomains 
		in their Wildcard certificates, which provides a method of name authentication that is compatible with Windows Mobile 5.</p>,<p>March 7, 2007 -- In a combined effort with Microsoft, DigiCert is excited to introduce the new DigiCert Unified Communications (UC) Certificate.  UC certificates are sometimes called SAN Certificates, because they use Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to secure up to 25 different fully qualified domain names.  They are designed to work with the new Microsoft Unified Communications server.  In addition, UC certificates are an excellent solution for server administrators who wish to secure many different domain names with the same certificate.  Because all DigiCert UC certificates are issued with an unlimited server license, server administrators have the freedom to install their certificates to as many different server as they wish at no extra cost.</p>,<p>

		</p>,<p>
			<a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> encrypt the transfer of sensitive information online. From online shopping to secure email messages or even private health records, 
			SSL certificates have a wide variety of applications in every industry.
		</p>,<p>			
			DigiCert Wildcard Plus certificates can secure any subdomain using subject alternative names (SANs). A traditional wildcard certificate for 
			*.example.com will only secure a first-level subdomain of example.com such as mail.example.com. DigiCert's Wildcard Plus certificate uses SANs 
			to secure any subdomain of example.com, including multi-level subdomains such as mail.internal.example.com. With this new feature, all subdomains 
			can be secured with a single Wildcard Plus certificate from DigiCert. The base domain itself, example.com, is automatically included as a SAN in 
			every Wildcard Plus certificate as well, which increases compatibility and protects example.com with or without the ""www.""
		</p>,<p>	
			With the use of SANs, Wildcard Plus certificates also resolve the issue that some mobile devices have with the asterisk (*) syntax. 
			Since mobile devices support SANs, Wildcard Plus certificates enable them to accept the specific host name without the need to purchase a separate SSL certificate.
		</p>,<p>			
			Additionally, with DigiCert's Unlimited Server License, Wildcard Plus certificates give more freedom to use certificates anywhere without extra license fees. 
			The certificate can be put on any server and any platform using the Duplicates feature through the DigiCert account interface and customers are able to issue
			as many certificates as needed for as many subdomains as needed.
		</p>,<p>			
			DigiCert Wildcard Plus SSL certificates are available with various licensing options. DigiCert strives to provide the best value and support possible.

			<strong>Introduction</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			A flaw in the design of the TLS v. 1/SSL v. 3 (TLS/SSL) handshake process was discovered in 2009, and RFC 5746 (Feb. 2010) was released to update the
			protocol specification.   Since then, most system manufacturers have released patches to fix this flaw.   <span>Still, as of June 2011 approximately half of 
			the systems using TLS/SSL on the Internet have not implemented the patches needed to close this security hole.</span>  This vulnerability affects the secure 
			transport of HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, and other protocols that rely on TLS/SSL.   Industry representatives and security researchers who have looked into the
			problem note that sites with the TLS patch may still be vulnerable to this attack, known as the TLS renegotiation  Man-In-The-Middle attack (TLS Renego MITM).
			DigiCert is taking a proactive approach to this problem by contacting its customers to advise them of this potential vulnerability in their systems.
			<span>At some point in the future, connectivity problems may occur because of server non-compliance with RFC 5746.</span>
		</p>,<p>
			In other words, when RFC 5746 is fully deployed browser clients will refuse to connect to unpatched servers. 
		</p>,<p>
			<strong>Background</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			TLS/SSL allows both servers and clients to initiate a refresh or complete renegotiation of the encryption parameters used for TLS/SSL connections. 
			This ability gives the communicating parties an abbreviated process to resume a previously existing TLS/SSL session, often with a more secure set of 
			cryptographic parameters.  However, the design of the initial handshake and the renegotiation process had a gap that could allow a third party to send a 
			“client hello” and splice content into a client’s TLS/SSL session and then intercept TLS/SSL communications between the server and the client.   
		</p>,<p>
			Just to provide you with a brief overview, the typical TLS/SSL handshake process involves the following: 
		</p>,<p>
				<i><b>client hello</b> (highest TLS/SSL version supported, random number, suggested ciphers, suggested compression methods and, if the client is 
				attempting renegotiation, previous session ID)<br>		
				<b>server hello</b> (TLS/SSL version, random number, cipher suite and compression chosen and, if server is attempting renegotiation, previous session ID)<br>
				<b>server sends TLS/SSL certificate</b><br>
				<b>server hello done</b>
			</i></p>,<p>			
				<b>client key exchange</b> (preMasterSecret exchange and MasterSecret calculation)<br>
				<b>client change cipher spec</b><br>
				<b>client finished</b> (hash and MAC of previous handshake messages)
			</p>,<p>
				<b>server change cipher spec</b><br>
				<b>server finished</b>
			</p>,<p>			
				<b>GET /secure HTTP/1.1\r\n...</b>
			</p>,<p>	
				(For more information, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Resumed_TLS_handshake"">Wikipedia's article on TLS handshakes</a>).
			</p>,<p>	
			Using the TLS Renego MITM vulnerability, an attacker can either form a TLS connection to the server first, before the client 
			(for example, on a compromised machine in response to the client’s attempt at connection) or can use session renegotiation to effectuate the attack. 
			Even mutual certificate-based client authentication connections are vulnerable to the TLS Renego MITM attack.  More details on how various attack scenarios
			play out are provided in <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5746"">RFC 5746</a> and related discussions provided 
			<a href=""http://www.phonefactor.com/sslgapdocs/Renegotiating_TLS.pdf"">here</a>
			and <a href=""http://my.opera.com/securitygroup/blog/2010/01/23/alpha-testing-tls-renego-fix"">here</a>.  
		</p>,<p>
			<strong>Solution</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			The TLS/SSL specification in RFC 5746 applies to both full handshakes and session resumption handshakes.  
			Because pre-existing TLS/SSL specifications required systems to ignore a ClientHello extension if they did not understand it, 
			RFC 5746 specifies that the ClientHello either contain an empty  “renegotiation_info"" extension  or a Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) 
			as a pseudo cipher suite with the same semantics as an empty ""renegotiation_info"" extension.   When a client receives the ServerHello, 
			it must check to see if the server supports the ""renegotiation_info"" extension.   Assuming that secure renegotiation is supported per RFC 5746, 
			then for TLS renegotiation, the client can send the ""renegotiation_info"" extension.  If the server does not respond in accordance with RFC 5746, 
			the client MUST abort the renegotiation handshake.  Similarly, if a client does not respond in accordance with RFC 5746, then the server MUST abort 
			the renegotiation handshake.
		</p>,<p>
			For backward compatibility, a compliant client will be configurable for either allowing insecure renegotiation or aborting an attempt to renegotiate.  
			However, because some TLS servers do not support renegotiation at all there will be a transition period where problems will be encountered.
			From a server side, if the server does not receive the ""renegotiation_info"" extension or the SCSV, then RFC 5746 specifies that the 
			“secure_renegotiation” flag be set to FALSE.   Thereafter, if a ClientHello for renegotiation contains an empty  “renegotiation_info"" extension 
			or the SCSV, then the server MUST abort the handshake.
		</p>,<p>
			<strong>Product Information</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			<strong>Further Steps to Take for Secure TLS/SSL Communication</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			Finally, in addition to the fixes described above for the TLS Renego MITM attack, DigiCert recommends that server administrators disable SSL version 2 
			and disallow the use of weak cipher suites.  SSL version 2 provides no protection for the session negotiation handshake at the beginning of, nor at the
			end of the connection.  This means that a MITM attack can happen at any point during the communication (e.g. the MITM simply creates a false termination 
			message, splices into the SSL session, and deceives the parties into thinking their communication is still secure).   Allowing weak ciphers also 
			creates a problem.  A weak cipher is one with less than 128 bits of encryption (i.e. a string of 1 and 0s shorter than 128).   For example, the international 
			versions of IE 3 and Netscape used to provide only 40 bits of encryption.  Today, the minimum standard of 128 bits offers 88 additional bits of key length, 
			which means that there are 2^88 more possible combinations one would have to try in order to crack strong encryption.  Because support for SSL 2.0 and weak
			40-bit and 56-bit ciphers has been removed completely from several current browsers, such server configurations should no longer be necessary.

		</p>,<p>
			<b><i>DigiCert SSL Certificates Offer Unique Value in Its Industry</i></b>
			<i></i>
		</p>,<p>
	DigiCert has established new standards in the SSL market to include its Wildcard, <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/multi-domain-ssl.htm"">Unified Communications (UC)</a> certificates and		<a href=""https://www.digicert.com/mpki/"">Managed Public Key Infrastructure (MPKI)</a> services. By doing so, DigiCert has developed a
			flexible product suite tailored to different customer needs.
		</p>,<p>
			""DigiCert has found a growing niche within the SSL market by offering value-added features that simplify IT network management while maintaining
			competitive prices,"" said Martinez. ""In an era when companies are closely managing costs and requiring more productivity out of workers, DigiCert's
			products offer market advantages.""
		</p>,<p>
			<i>Wildcard</i>
		</p>,<p>
			While DigiCert's competitors offer Wildcard certificates that only cover the first-level, or a limited number of subdomains, DigiCert has developed a
			cutting-edge Wildcard certificate that encrypts and secures any subdomain, using subject alternative names (SANs). The addition of SANs to Wildcard
			certificates make them compatible with mobile devices.
		</p>,<p>
			For network administrators who run multiple subdomains or multiple servers, most SSL certificate authorities on the market require them to purchase
			multiple certificates for their networks. DigiCert's Wildcard certificate benefits administrators in that just one certificate secures multiple web
			properties.
		</p>,<p>
			<i>Unified Communications</i>
		</p>,<p>
			Exceeding industry standards, DigiCert offers Unified communications (UC) certificates which let an administrator secure up to 25 server names with one
			certificate. The UC certificates allow customers to add, remove or edit SANs from within their account through the certificate's lifetime. In addition,
			UC and Wildcard customers can issue free duplicate certificates assigned to unique private keys. DigiCert offers this security feature so organizations
			do not have to export and install the same certificate on multiple systems.
		</p>,<p>
			<i>Managed Public Key Infrastructure</i>
		</p>,<p>
			For larger organizations using multiple servers, DigiCert offers Managed Public Key Infrastructure (MPKI) services. This web-based interface allows
			account administrators to take control of SSL certificate management-including issuing new certificates and reissuing, replacing and revoking existing
			certificates on-demand-eliminating the short waiting period associated with retail requests.
		</p>,<p>
			The <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificate</a> market has three different segments within each certificate type. With
			domain validation, organization validation and an extended validation certificate, customers have different requirements from their certificates,
			serving different organization tier levels. While many certificate authorities offer all three types of certificates, some forgo this option to
			establish their position and brand in the markets they serve.
		</p>,<p>
			As a leading company in the mid- to top-tier of the SSL certificate market, DigiCert centers its products on organization validation and extended
			validation certificates, which offer an extra layer of validation and a higher level of assurance than domain validation certificates.
		</p>,<p>
			""While price sensitivity at these levels is not as high as with domain validation certificate customers, DigiCert aims to provide a commendable,
			high-value certificate at competitive prices,"" said Martinez. ""DigiCert's commitment to the highest quality and cost-effective security testifies to
			the company's efforts to provide best-in-class products for its respective target markets.""
		</p>,<p>
			Each year, Frost &amp; Sullivan presents this award to the company that demonstrates excellence in implementing strategies that proactively create
			value for customers with a focus on improving the return on the investment. This award recognizes the company's focus on enhancing the value that its
			customers receive, beyond simply good customer service, leading to improved customer retention and ultimately, customer base expansion.
		</p>,<p>
			Frost &amp; Sullivan Best Practices awards recognize companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement
			and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service and strategic product development. Industry analysts

			Compatible with Microsoft, new certificates broaden company’s recognized “best in class” SSL certificates to kernel-mode software programmers and engineers.
		</p>,<p>
			Lindon, Utah - February 28, 2012 - Today, DigiCert, Inc., an online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and websites in the world, announced that its code signing high-assurance digital certificates are now compatible with Microsoft kernel-mode software. With this extension to its growing product suite, DigiCert becomes one of just a handful of global Certificate Authorities (CA) to offer this service. Microsoft requires developers to digitally sign kernel-mode software for its Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 operating systems prior to installation.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert continues to broaden its product offerings in response to consumer demand for code signing certificates that are compatible with various operating systems,” said DigiCert Chief Operations Officer Nicholas Hales. “We recognize that today’s network engineers and software developers face increasing responsibilities and security concerns; as with all of our products and services, DigiCert’s kernel-mode certificates are available at competitive rates backed by value-added features and unmatched customer support to increase the efficiency and productivity of the IT department.”
		</p>,<p>
			Kernel-mode certificates allow users to digitally sign software and device drivers, which in turn proves identity to users and protects software from being modified after creation. Failing to digitally sign kernel-mode software with a certificate from a reliable third-party leads to a warning in Windows that prevents users from installing any code. DigiCert kernel-mode code signing certificates support Silverlight 4 and work with ActiveX controls, plug-ins and other executables, and they include an optional timestamp to show when the code was signed.
		</p>,<p>
			The world’s third-largest issuer of high-assurance digital certificates, DigiCert continues to expand market share through a company focus on enhanced customer value—recently recognized with Frost &amp; Sullivan’s “Best in Class” award—and unmatched support. With the company’s kernel-mode signing, customers get the same quick installation and customer support they have come to expect from a knowledgeable team that is available 24/7 via phone or chat.

			Leading expert on Managed Public Key Infrastructure customization will discuss how tool can help establish trust in the Internet as a platform for medical data sharing
		</p>,<p>
			Lindon, Utah - February 23, 2012 - Data breaches at healthcare organizations surged 32 percent according to a Dec. 2011 study released by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored by ID Experts, and tools that enhance trust in web platforms are at a premium. Scott Rea, VP of Education/Government Relations and Sr. PKI Architect at <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, an online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and websites in the world, will discuss enterprise security solutions Feb. 23 at the HIMSS 2012 Conference in Las Vegas. Rea’s remarks come on the heels of reports from the same Ponemon study that data breaches cost U.S. healthcare organizations $6 billion a year. Managed Public Key Infrastructure (MPKI) systems enable trust and give control to network administrators who are especially concerned with devices brought into the workplace by employees and third-parties.
		</p>,<p>
			“Notable organizations, particularly in medium- to large-sized enterprises, are increasingly looking to exercise greater control over the inbound and outbound messages on their servers as well as management of mobile devices connected to the network,” said Rea. “With MPKI, IT administrators can protect multiple servers and domains, authenticating online exchanges through one certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority like DigiCert.”
		</p>,<p>
			A seasoned implementer of Managed PKI systems, Rea is an active member of several PKI-related forums including the Federal PKI Policy Authority Certificate Policy Working Group, the Research and Education Bridge Certification Authority, the Four Bridges Forum, and the International Grid Trust Federation. In his role at DigiCert, he works with many clients, particularly in the higher education, medical and government arenas, to set up customized MPKI solutions. Joining Rea in the eCollaboration forum will be Jonathan Hare from Resilient Network Systems, Brian Ahier from Mid-Columbia Medical Center and Dr. David Kibbe from The Kibbe Group.

			“Securing sensitive information exchanged over the Internet remains a top priority for the federal government,” said FPKI Policy Authority Chair Deborah Gallagher. “We’re pleased to welcome DigiCert as an approved Certificate Authority under the PIV-I program, authorized to issue trusted certificates at multiple levels of assurance to federal agencies and the organizations that work closely with the federal government.”
		</p>,<p>
			To date, only a few Certificate Authorities have been approved by the FPKIPA’s stringent requirements. “DigiCert is proud to be certified by the FPKIPA,” says Scott Rea, VP of Government and Education Relations at DigiCert. “By earning this certification, we will be able to magnify our support of our federal clients and their business partners in their missions to enhance online security.”
		</p>,<p>
			The mission of the FPKIPA is to enforce digital certificate standards for trusted identity authentication across the federal agencies and between federal agencies and outside bodies, such as universities, state and local governments and commercial entities. In accordance with this mission, the FPKIPA established the FBCA to simplify the transfer of sensitive information by accepting certificates for transactions.

The long-planned announcements come amid aggressive growth at DigiCert and Bretschneider’s formation of a strong executive leadership team to carry forward the company’s day-to-day operations.
		</p>,<p>
			Hales, who has been DigiCert’s COO since early 2010, has been instrumental in the company’s efforts to attract top talent and increase its market share. Under his leadership, DigiCert has enjoyed revenue growth of nearly 120 percent – continuing its strong growth trends in 2012 – and has been recognized with multiple awards for its customer value, customer support and flexible workplace.
		</p>,<p>
			“Nick brings the perfect blend of experience, business and technical savvy, and temperament to accelerate DigiCert’s exceptional growth and success,” said DigiCert Founder and Executive Chairman of the Board Ken Bretschneider. “I join with my fellow DigiCert board members and our company’s employees in expressing our utmost confidence and support in Nick and his talented team.”
		</p>,<p>

"<p>
			LINDON, UT (April 26, 2012) — <a href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, an online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and websites in the world, today launched the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/discovery-tool.htm"">DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool</a>. Available to anyone free of charge, the web-based application scans an organization’s network to locate SSL certificates deployed across several departments and business units, regardless of which Certificate Authority (CA) issued the certificate. The DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool is designed to help busy IT professionals save time and money, and avoid costly mistakes from manual inventory. A shutdown caused by an unforeseen certificate expiration on a critical server could significantly disrupt business and even lead to compliance issues.
		</p>,<p>
			Many medium to large enterprises may have hundreds, if not thousands, of certificates deployed at any given time. Businesses that choose to employ enterprise solutions such as DigiCert’s <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/mpki/"">Enterprise Managed PKI</a> products, may simplify SSL certificate management through centralization. However, in the case of organizations without a centralized approach – or even with some companies that employ enterprise management – the deployment of just one outlier certificate from another certificate provider can go unnoticed and potentially wreak havoc.
		</p>,<p>
			“Over time, with organizational growth and increasing use of cloud IT and mobile integration, some SSL certificates can fall through the cracks,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “The DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool simplifies the task of controlling large deployments of SSL certificates from multiple authorities across diverse platforms, giving administrators the tools they need at their fingertips to avoid SSL downtime and maximize certificate value.”
		</p>,<p>
			The DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool streamlines certificate management and eases renewal by allowing administrators to sign up for e-mail alerts seven and 30 days prior to expiration, regardless of which CA issued the certificate. For DigiCert customers, they may take advantage of integration with the company’s client account tools for one-stop certificate renewals. Free and simple to install, anyone can get the Discovery Tool by entering their information at digicert.com. After that, a registrant receives an e-mail with a link to download the application and an activation code to get it running.
		</p>,<p>
			“Certificate management and tracking, especially for those companies using more than one CA for their security needs, can be difficult,” said Richard Martinez, research analyst for Frost &amp; Sullivan. “DigiCert’s SSL Discovery Tool is yet another value-added service and a continuation of a customer-friendly approach that has earned the company ‘best in class’ status for offering customer value enhancement.”
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert is the recognized leader in flexible, <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">high-assurance SSL</a> certificates and award-winning customer support. The DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool is the latest in a series of SSL deployment web applications and trainings provided by the company for use by anyone, free of charge.

Founded in 2003, DigiCert operates its corporate headquarters in Lindon, Utah, from which it serves a client base of more than 50,000 organizations from 146 countries.
		</p>,<p>
			In nine years, DigiCert has grown to become the world’s third-largest issuer of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">high-assurance SSL certificates</a>. Forming the backbone of e-commerce, internet banking and social networking today, these certificates help protect online identity and privacy through authentication and encryption services. For example, customers visiting their favorite online retail sites can have confidence when entering their login and credit card information that the site is authentic and not a duplicate set up for phishing purposes. In most browsers, a secure SSL connection is shown with a padlock icon or “https” in the URL. Higher-assurance certificates that include Extended Validation feature a green address bar.
		</p>,<p>
			A rapidly growing company with an empowering culture, DigiCert has been recognized by Utah Business magazine as one of Utah’s Best Places to Work and by the State of Utah Department of Workforce Services for its efforts to promote employee Work/Life Balance. Recently, DigiCert was also recognized for “Business Excellence in Workplace Flexibility” by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. DigiCert offers competitive wages and benefits including an annual week-long expenses-paid vacation bonus for each employee.

			SAN FRANCISCO, CA (June 20, 2012) — Today GlobalSign, DigiCert, Comodo and NGINX announced a joint effort and a sponsored development contract, to enhance the NGINX open source Web server to support OCSP-stapling. This collaboration further advances the SSL ecosystem by improving the privacy, reliability and revocation checking for all websites using the NGINX web server — currently run by more than 25 percent of the top 1,000 websites, and by 70 million websites on the Internet overall.
		</p>,<p>
			“The team at NGINX is delighted that GlobalSign, DigiCert and Comodo support the OCSP stapling enhancement to the NGINX webserver,” said Igor Sysoev CTO and principal architect at NGINX, “We have been continuously working on enhancements to NGINX that increase performance, reliability and security.  With improved SSL functionality, we expect the vast majority of our customers to share our enthusiasm for increased safety on the Internet.”
		</p>,<p>
			The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is used to present the revocation status, or current validity, of an SSL certificate, and provides an alternative to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) method. OCSP offers efficiencies when compared to the CRL method, which requires the client, such as a browser, to download potentially large databases of revocation information reflecting the status as of its last publication date In contrast, OCSP can provide more up-to-date status information by allowing the browser to query the revocation status at the very point of encountering the certificate, without relying on cached information.
		</p>,<p>
			OCSP-stapling enhances the basic OCSP method by allowing the presenter of a certificate, such as the website hosting the SSL certificate, to deliver the OCSP response to the browser instead of it being delivered by the issuing CA. By keeping the certificate response within the web host and not with the CA, OCSP-stapling ensures the browser receives the same response performance for the certificate status information as it does for the website content. This helps to maintain a high-quality user experience and avoids delays otherwise caused by request volume or network congestion that can slow CA response under the standard OCSP method. Compared with basic OCSP, privacy concerns are also addressed, as the CA is no longer receiving revocation requests directly from the browser. 
		</p>,<p>
			In a collective statement by GlobalSign, DigiCert and Comodo, GlobalSign Chief Technology Officer Ryan Hurst stated, “By addressing the issues holding back common usage of OCSP, NGINX is contributing toward a unified goal of widespread OCSP adoption across all webservers on the Internet.  This project is another major initiative where certification authorities are working closely to improve the ecosystem for everyone relying on SSL for a safer, private and more secure Internet experience.” 
		</p>,<p>
			NGINX is the second most popular open source webserver and, according to the W3Techs server survey, is currently used by more than 25 percent of the top 1,000 most visited websites.  The new version with full OCSP-stapling support will be available in late August 2012. IIS on Microsoft Server 2008 and Apache 2.3.6 already support OCSP-stapling; thus, the enhancements to NGINX mean that nearly all webservers can now deploy this critical technology.
		</p>,<p>
			For current release information on the new version of NGINX, please visit <a href=""http://www.nginx.com/"">www.nginx.com</a>.
		</p>,<p>
			<b>About NGINX</b>
		</p>,<p>
			Run by the busiest websites on the Internet, NGINX enables businesses worldwide to match rapidly increasing demand for faster web experience without incurring unnecessary costs in capital investments or time.  In almost 10 years of its history, NGINX became key software component of most famous web architectures.  Today NGINX serves over 25 percent of the top 1,000 websites, and 70 million of websites overall.  Successful online services, transforming and shaping the future of Internet—such as Netflix, Pinterest, CloudFlare, Airbnb, WordPress, GitHub, SoundCloud, Zynga, Eventbrite, Zappos, Media Temple, Heroku, RightScale, Engine Yard, use NGINX as part of their infrastructures.
		</p>,<p>
			In July 2011, NGINX founded its commercial arm, Nginx, Inc, to facilitate the development of NGINX.  For more information, please visit <a href=""http://www.nginx.com/"">www.nginx.com</a>.

			BOSTON, MA (July 17, 2012) — Today, as the nation’s leading web hosting providers gather in Boston for the HostingCon 2012 conference, DigiCert is inviting resellers to enable customer business success by providing high-assurance <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a>, issued within hours. Throughout the show, company staff will be available at Booth #229 to discuss how DigiCert can help web hosts quickly and easily deploy high-assurance SSL certificates, such as Extended Validation (EV) certificates, that increase customer trust and conversion.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert is pleased to offer partnering opportunities for web hosts and other resellers seeking to provide high-assurance SSL certificates to their customers,” said DigiCert VP of Sales Aaron Watson. “We’re excited to combine one of the SSL industry’s largest libraries of free tools, award-winning customer support, fast issuance times and competitive pricing to help web hosts deliver premium value to their customers.”
		</p>,<p>
			Recent studies demonstrate the trends toward increasing adoption of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/extended-validation-ev-ssl.htm"">EV SSL</a> certificates. Last month, the Online Trust Alliance released its 2012 Online Trust Honor Roll and Report, which noted a 48 percent increase in EV certificate deployment over 2011 among those surveyed. As consumers more closely scrutinize where they will conduct online business and e-commerce, EV certificates offer the heightened security measures and browser bar trust indicators that can lead to higher conversions for online merchants. With increasing conversions and revenues, web hosts choosing to employ EV certificates can yield greater customer loyalty, retention and business while also solidifying their brand as a security-minded firm.
		</p>,<p>
			As a leading Certificate Authority (CA) and the world’s third-largest issuer of high-assurance certificates, DigiCert brings to resellers an unmatched value proposition of best security practices, competitive pricing for <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">EV SSL certificates</a> and hassle-free customer support. The company also offers its <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/discovery-tool.htm"">SSL Discovery Tool</a> free of charge, which web hosts can utilize to help current and prospective customers identify and address their security needs. DigiCert’s focus on customer value and partnership led to its being named “Best in Class” for SSL Customer Value Enhancement in 2011 by Frost &amp; Sullivan.
		</p>,<p>
			“Now is an opportune time for resellers to pass along the DigiCert value to their customers, while enjoying enhanced partner revenue and a simplified certificate deployment process,” said Watson.

			LINDON, UT (August 14, 2012) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and web sites in the world, today announced a major breakthrough in application code security with the availability of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm"">Extended Validation Code Signing Certificates</a>.
		</p>,<p>
			EV Code Signing Certificates from DigiCert must adhere to strict validation procedures from the CA/Browser Forum and Microsoft specifications. In addition to passing through DigiCert’s thorough and rigorous review, EV Code Signing customers employ hardware to receive and install their certificate.
		</p>,<p>
			Additionally, <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm"">EV Code Signing Certificates</a> from DigiCert can enable code developers for Windows 8, Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 to immediately establish initial reputation with SmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that file or publisher. SmartScreen simplifies trust decisions by only providing warnings for applications without established reputation. EV Code Signing Certificates also help ensure that as developers renew their certificates, the reputation established with the original certificate remains intact across renewals.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert’s  EV Code Signing Certificates can be trusted by Microsoft SmartScreen reputation services starting today, meaning that application developers can establish reputation in Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 9 and 10 immediately,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “Additionally, developers can rely upon DigiCert as a code-signing partner committed to high assurance and customer support to take care of any needs they might have throughout the lifecycle of their certificate.”
		</p>,<p>
			Continued Hales, “The additional safeguards afforded developers who sign their code with EV <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/"">Code Signing</a> Certificates include two-factor authentication with a physical token, which provides an improved barrier against malware and other attacks.”
		</p>,<p>
			“We are pleased to support the certificate authority industry’s introduction of Extended Validation Code Signing Certificates as a step forward to help ensure developer identity, code signing security and user safety,” said Microsoft General Manager – Safety Services, John Scarrow. “These new certificates provide deep verification of developer identity and, in addition, require a hardware element to further secure the code signing process. Given these advances, EV signed applications can immediately establish reputation with Microsoft’s SmartScreen Application Reputation services in Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10 and Windows 8.”
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert EV Code Signing customers gain access to an array of free training and tools as well as the company’s award-winning customer support team. EV Code Signing certificates from DigiCert are available at <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm"">https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm</a> with various licensing options up to three years.

			DigiCert employs a tenured, knowledgeable staff to help guide customers through the process of organization and extended validation to avoid unnecessary delays and save customers valuable time. Prioritizing security, DigiCert retains the steps required to ensure a thoroughly validated and authenticated certificate.

			“DigiCert serves as our primary <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/welcome/ssl-plus.htm"">SSL</a> provider, because of their amazing customer support and prompt turnaround,” said Jason Webber, Director of Information Technology at HubSpot, Inc. “With a rapidly growing organization, we see great value in DigiCert’s knowledgeable, friendly support staff and tools to help us securely and quickly deploy new certificates, with the confidence that the company will be there throughout all stages of the certificate lifecycle.”

			The issuance of high-assurance certificates may take days or even weeks with some providers, motivating organizations to settle for lower-assurance options such as domain-validated certificates. DigiCert’s capabilities mean that organizations no longer have to choose between high-assurance and speed of issuance. At a time when consumers are demanding greater trust of the websites where they choose to do business – online retailers are responding in 2012 with a 48 percent increase in <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">EV SSL</a> deployment over 2011, according to a June Online Trust Association report – DigiCert makes high-assurance certificates a clear choice, typically fulfilling orders within less than an hour, not days.

DigiCert is webtrust-audited and actively promotes the highest standards within the industry groups to which it belongs. Additionally, DigiCert stands behind its commitment to quality with a $1 million warranty and a 30-day money back guarantee for any dissatisfied customers.

			(February 14, 2013) — Each day, DigiCert works hard to provide the best value to you, our customers. We compete hard to be your preferred Certificate Authority (CA), and we appreciate your business.
		</p>,<p>
			On certain matters, however, we choose to put aside competition and collaborate with other CAs to promote activities and practices that will advance internet security. That’s why we are announcing today the formation of the CA Security Council (CASC), an industry leadership initiative designed to promote best practices in the issuance, deployment, and use of SSL.
		</p>,<p>
			For nearly two decades, SSL has formed the backbone of internet security.  Today, SSL continues to be the best method of protecting sensitive information that is exchanged online. Each day, members of the CASC secure billions of online connections. Because of the high value of these transactions, we have seen an increase in the number and sophistication of attacks by cybercriminal organizations, hacktivists, and even state-sponsored espionage, making a group dedicated to promoting practical enhancements and global standards a necessity.
		</p>,<p>
			Through the CASC, DigiCert can collaborate with other interested stakeholders in improving awareness of critical policies developed in other venues and their potential impact on the internet infrastructure. Members of the CASC are coming together to help encourage best practices, promote improved deployment of a continually trustworthy SSL ecosystem, and help educate end-users on how SSL works and how they can keep themselves safe.
		</p>,<p>
			Coinciding with the CASC launch, the group is announcing the first of a planned series of educational and advocacy efforts related to best practices in SSL deployment.  The group’s initial focus is on the importance of online certificate status checking and revocation. These first efforts will help people understand the benefits of online certificate status protocol (OCSP) stapling and how it can be widely implemented to help provide a more secure internet.

			Coinciding with its launch, the CASC is announcing the first of a planned series of educational and advocacy efforts related to best practices in SSL deployment with a focus on the importance of online certificate status checking and revocation. Specifically, the CASC will highlight the benefits of online certificate status protocol (OCSP) stapling for Web server administrators, software vendors, browser developers, and end-users through blog posts, conference presentations and other resources.

The CASC is focused on promoting tightened global standards to mitigate high-profile security incidents, and improving research and collaboration that will continue to establish the security-robustness of the SSL ecosystem.

			EAST LANSING, MI (March 5, 2013) — Today the Michigan Health Information Network (MiHIN) Shared Services announced an agreement with leading high-assurance digital certificate provider DigiCert and health information services provider (HISP) Nitor Group to use DigiCert’s federally bridged certificates for secure interstate sharing of electronic health information. This project, one of the first of its kind in the U.S., supports MiHIN’s mission to improve healthcare outcomes for Michigan residents by providing trusted means by which patients, providers and insurers can securely exchange private medical records across state boundaries. The announcement also serves as a model of an effective public-private relationship to other states working to implement and carry out the Meaningful Use stages.
		</p>,<p>
			The new solution allows MiHIN to issue federally bridged digital certificates from DigiCert to efficiently and securely transfer encrypted electronic health records of Michigan residents between accredited healthcare providers and insurers with respect to Michigan residents wherever they may receive treatment. This capability significantly shortens the time required to receive critical electronic records at the point of care and improve patient outcomes while also lowering costs. DigiCert is the first publicly trusted Certificate Authority to issue certificates that meet the Direct protocols for health information exchange and are cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority. Given its prominent role in drafting the governance aspects of the Direct protocol that will be used in the DirectTrust community, DigiCert is lending its expertise and infrastructure in working with HISPs, insurers and state exchanges to support compliance across the country.
		</p>,<p>
			MiHIN Chief Security Officer Brian Seggie commented, “With DigiCert’s new federally bridged security certificates MiHIN is now able to go into full production with secure exchange of patient health information between Michigan and our five border states, our “snowbird” states in warmer climes, and other states that Michigan residents frequently visit where they sometimes receive treatment. In some sense, this is as exciting as building the interstate highway system, but for the timely and secure exchange of information between states that will improve patient outcomes and in some cases, potentially save lives.”
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert is pleased to be able to work with MiHIN and Nitor Group to advance this critical work on behalf of the state of Michigan and its residents and health providers,” said DigiCert VP of Government, Education Relations and Senior PKI Architect Scott Rea, who also serves on the board of DirectTrust. “As an organization, we’re committed to contributing our expertise within DirectTrust to help improve the quality and affordability of healthcare through the Direct initiative.”
		</p>,<p>
			MiHIN Senior Integration and Design Architect Jeff Shaw observed, “Using the Direct secure message technology and these new enhanced certifications allows MiHIN to transport health information while ensuring that the information remains securely encrypted between providers in Michigan and in other states. Using federally bridged certificates also allows exchange with federal agencies, such as the Center for Disease Control for public health issues and the Veterans Health Administration to ensure that those who served our country receive the best care possible. This secure means of sharing health information across state lines gives health professionals across the nation an easy-to-use platform that can also scale upwards to grow as health information sharing evolves.”
		</p>,<p>
			The Direct Project was initiated in early 2010 under the direction of the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services and the ONC with the goal of benefitting patients and providers by improving the transport of health information, making it faster, more secure and less expensive. The Direct Project establishes scalable standards and documentation to support simple scenarios of pushing data from point-to-point in a trusted way that improves interoperability by providing rules-based methods of interstate and interagency sharing. It also improves healthcare outcomes by moving this type of information sharing away from traditional mail and fax methods.
		</p>,<p>
			David C. Kibbe, MD, MBA, is the President and CEO of DirectTrust, a non-profit trade alliance created by and for Direct community participants to provide a national Security and Trust Framework. Dr. Kibbe believes that the MiHIN-DigiCert-Nitor Group agreement represents the future of healthcare informatics in providing the proper technological controls to ensure secure, timely information sharing to improve healthcare outcomes.
		</p>,<p>
			Said Kibbe, “The public-private collaboration that this program represents is a model for the way in which Directed exchange should bring standards based, inter-vendor and cross boundary electronic health information exchange to healthcare providers and patients alike in the U.S. Nitor and DigiCert will work with MiHIN to make Directed exchange easy, affordable, and ubiquitous, while making sure that the security and trust-in-identity the public demands is firmly in place.”
		</p>,<p>
			Nitor Group, a Direct-qualified HISP, facilitated this agreement. The company looks forward to its continued collaboration with DirectTrust and DigiCert to advance the interoperability and efficiency of state HIE’s.
		</p>,<p>
			Doug Hill, a Partner with the Nitor Group stated, “MiHIN’s agreements with Nitor Group and DigiCert show a dedication to security and privacy which are critical to the increased electronic exchange of health information.”

			LINDON, UT and MORRISTOWN, N.J. (June 12, 2013) — DigiCert, the leading high-assurance <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">digital certificate</a> provider, and DataMotion, an innovative <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.datamotion.com/DirectProject/HealthcareDirectvendor.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">health information service provider (HISP)</a> with more than 14 years of experience in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.datamotion.com/DirectProject/HealthcareDirectHIE.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">secure data delivery services</a>, today announced a groundbreaking partnership to expand common dual-mode certification for commercial and federal use for the healthcare industry. The partnership promises to improve patient care by making it much simpler for federal and non-federal organizations to engage in the secure electronic exchange of healthcare information.
		</p>,<p>
			The DigiCert/DataMotion partnership is a major step forward in fulfilling the vision of DirectTrust, an independent non-profit trade association tasked with overcoming secure data transfer challenges related to the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/direct-project/"">Direct Project</a>. Overseen by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, the Direct Project is a federal healthcare initiative fostering a standard method to securely exchange electronic healthcare information. It is aimed at ensuring compliance with federal privacy requirements and improving patient outcomes.
		</p>,<p>
			The partnership makes DataMotion the first HISP to use DigiCert’s dual-mode Direct Med Certificate Authority (Direct Med CA) in the DirectTrust Transitional Trust Anchor Bundle. The Bundle is a collection of trust anchor certificates from HISPs that meet common policies and practices for transmitting healthcare data across geographies and technologies. It eliminates the need for HISPs to manually exchange trust anchors, avoiding complex legal hurdles and one-off contracts. Direct secure messaging leverages the Internet and is far more efficient and secure than fax-based communication. As a result, participating HISPs can quickly help healthcare organizations, providers and patients to communicate in a way that is Direct-compliant and with an expanding community of trusted partners.
		</p>,<p>
			“The DigiCert Direct Med CA leverages policy processing capabilities to make the Direct protocol much more efficient to implement. This breakthrough eases certification difficulties that have threatened to stall adoption of the Direct Project,” said DigiCert’s Vice President of Government/Education Relations and Senior PKI Architect, Scott Rea, also a member of the Board of Directors for DirectTrust. “We need a national security and trust framework with a foundation of standards-based accreditation, supported by technology to easily on-board healthcare providers. Because our Direct Med CA facilitates commercial and federal use for multiple trust assurance levels, more providers will now be able to quickly and safely exchange information more efficiently. By partnering with DataMotion - a leading HISP with a secure data delivery pedigree - we’re able to get this to market quickly and help build the DirectTrust community.”
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert has been at the forefront of Direct-related innovation and was first to issue Direct-compliant Federal Bridge Certification Authority certificates for Federal agencies to interoperate with non-federal organizations. Combined with digital certificates for commercial entities, the Direct Med CA can now serve all of healthcare with basic and medium assurance levels. By incorporating this capability into its HISP services, DataMotion is now able to offer a turnkey solution that will enable electronic health record (EHR) vendors and their customers to easily meet real-world healthcare communications needs.
		</p>,<p>
			“This takes a huge burden off of healthcare providers by greatly simplifying their use of Direct messaging,” said DataMotion Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Bob Janacek. “Through this partnership EHR vendors now have a comprehensive solution for Direct communications, resulting in an easier path for providers to achieve Meaningful Use Stage 2 attestation, and better healthcare outcomes for patients.”

			LINDON, UT (June 10, 2013) — Today, leading global authentication and encryption company, DigiCert, Inc., announced the availability of a revolutionary Certificate Utility for Windows that allows administrators to generate and install SSL certificates with just a single click. The DigiCert single click SSL installer automatically generates the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), downloads the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificate</a>, and installs the certificate on the server. Administrators no longer need to navigate cumbersome interfaces or memorize complicated commands.
		</p>,<p>
			After purchasing a certificate, pre-verified administrators can use the utility to automatically create a private key and CSR, send the CSR to DigiCert, issue the certificate, and install the certificate directly on their server.
		</p>,<p>
			Many security engineers and network administrators interface with SSL certificates only when deploying a new server or renewing an existing SSL certificate. For these professionals, the process required to create a CSR, undergo rigorous organizational validation, and install a certificate extracts too many cycles from their already busy schedule.

			LEHI, UT (August 15, 2013) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading global authentication and encryption provider, helps network administrators prepare their security environments for ICANN’s pending release of new gTLDs with the DigiCert® Internal Name Tool for Microsoft Exchange (Internal Name Tool). The free SAAS application provides a step-by-step guide to help administrators reconfigure their MS Exchange 2013 and earlier version Exchange servers to point to fully qualified domain names (FQDN) – mitigating potential security risks posed by the new gTLDs.
		</p>,<p>
			Available to anyone, whether or not they are a DigiCert customer, the Internal Name Tool may be particularly beneficial for network administrators deploying <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/multi-domain-ssl.htm"">Unified Communications certificates</a> (UCC) as a way of securing multiple servers within the enterprise. The Certification Authority/Browser Forum (CA/B Forum) will require FQDNs for SANS on UC certificates by fall 2015. In 2011, the CA/B Forum deprecated issuance of certificates to internal names, which becomes effective following a multi-year phase-out period to allow companies time to update their systems. Furthermore, ICANN registration of new gTLDs ahead of Fall 2015 may pose additional risk to non-public domain extensions.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert continues to work within the CA/B Forum and with other industry bodies to advance standards and practices that enhance online security; we also recognize the continued value of flexible <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL Certificate</a> deployment for unified communications within organizations of all sizes,” said DigiCert Chief Technology Officer Paul Tiemann. “The DigiCert Internal Name Tool simplifies the compliance efforts of network security professionals, saving them time and money, as well as headache, as they reconfigure their Exchange servers to meet the new requirements and secure their most valuable data assets.”
		</p>,<p>
			Utilizing the Internal Name Tool not only can help administrators with their compliance goals but it gives them the peace of mind of knowing that the Internal Name tool automates the entire process, including changing minor settings with which they may not be familiar. The Internal Name Tool works for any Exchange environment and includes logging capabilities to provide full transparency to administrators.
		</p>,<p>
			For more information, see the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/internal-domain-name-tool.htm"">DigiCert Internal Name Tool</a> page. DigiCert is prepared to help organizations accommodate the changes brought on by the release of new gTLDs, including offering high-assurance certificates to new FQDNs to be registered with the new extensions.

			LEHI, UT (September 24, 2013) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading global authentication and encryption provider, announced today that it is the first Certificate Authority (CA) to implement Certificate Transparency (CT). DigiCert has been working with Google to pilot CT for more than a year and will begin adding <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL Certificates</a> to a public CT log by the end of October.
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert welcomes CT as an important step toward enhancing online trust. For several months, DigiCert has been working with Google engineers to test Google’s code, provide feedback on proposed CT implementations, and build CT support into the company’s systems. This initiative aligns with DigiCert’s focus to improve online trust—including tight internal security controls, development and adoption of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements and Network Security Guidelines, and participation in various industry bodies that are focused on security and trust standards.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert’s business is built on trust, and we are committed to lead the industry toward better practices that enhance online security,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “Certificate Transparency accomplishes this goal by shining a light on certificate issuance practices and building in a scalable early detection system that relies upon trusted, widely used technologies and standards. We applaud Google for its forward-thinking mindset in advancing CT closer to implementation.”
		</p>,<p>
			CT provides early detection and mitigation of misissued or rogue SSL Certificates because it requires certificates to be posted to a public log. Google welcomes DigiCert’s efforts to advance CT adoption and awareness.
		</p>,<p>
			“We’re pleased to receive DigiCert’s declaration of support for CT and are encouraged by their continued work with us to help improve online trust and security,” said Ben Laurie, creator of CT and software security engineer at Google. “This is an important step that we hope other CAs will follow as we look to provide greater structural integrity to the SSL/TLS Certificate system.”

			LEHI, UT (May 20, 2014) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, has been named to the Red Herring Top 100 North America, a prestigious list recognizing the continent’s most successful private technology companies. Past recipients include Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Skype, Salesforce.com, YouTube, Marin Software, Palo Alto Networks and eBay.

			“DigiCert is honored to be listed among the current and past recipients of this award, which include many of the technology industry’s most notable companies,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “We are humbled by our success and we are grateful for our partnership with our customers, whose support is the reason why we are in this position.

		</p>,<p>
			Red Herring has been selecting the most exciting and promising privately held technology firms since 1995. Top 100 companies are evaluated individually among a pool of thousands of candidates based across North America, and are reviewed against several criteria, including the company's addressable market size, technological innovation and intellectual property, business model, financial performance, management quality, customer footprint and market penetration. This past week, hundreds of finalists presented their companies to a panel of distinguished investment bankers and venture capitalists to be judged on their market relevance, growth and prospects.
		</p>,<p>
			“In 2014, selecting the top 100 achievers was by no means a small feat,” said Alex Vieux, publisher and CEO of Red Herring. “In fact, we had the toughest time in years because so many entrepreneurs had crossed significant milestones so early. But after much thought, rigorous contemplation and discussion, we narrowed our list down from hundreds of candidates from across North America to the top 100 winners. We believe DigiCert embodies the vision, drive and innovation that define a successful entrepreneurial venture. DigiCert should be proud of its accomplishment, as the competition was very strong.”

"<p>
			The language of the future is digital; and with emerging technologies, this future will include interconnected devices that automate the management of the appliances and devices we depend on every day.
		</p>,<p>
			We’re seeing the dawn of an era where even the most mundane items are communicating among themselves with little human interaction. Emerging technologies are turning the Internet of Things (IoT), into the Internet of Everything.
		</p>,<p>
			Your thermostat detects movement and automatically adjusts the temperature in your home. Over time it senses your preferences and learns when to turn on and off.  Your alarm clock can send a signal to your coffee pot and it starts brewing your morning coffee. As your car pulls into your driveway, your home disables the security system and unlocks the front door.
		</p>,<p>
			The Internet of Things brings to life a vision of the future where the more manual aspects of life can be automated so we can enjoy more meaningful living. Through widespread advancements in smart technologies, the time to a fully connected world is rapidly advancing. 
		</p>,<p>
			How we connect devices is changing how we work and live. While with the touch of a smart device we can manage the intricate details of our life, new security consequences complicate the capability of these devices.
		</p>,<p>
			Unsecured, smart devices counteract the convenience of the Internet of Things. Many advancements in technology today come without the consideration of potential threats; and without the proper security framework in place, the IoT enables new methods for home and privacy invasion.
		</p>,<p>
			As the Internet of Things become more commonplace in the devices we use daily, it will increase the number targets for data security threats.
		</p>,<p>
			And security threats to Internet of Things aren’t theoretical—they’re already happening. Recent attacks like the <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28208905"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“smart” light bulb password leaks</a>, <a href=""http://readwrite.com/2014/04/30/connected-home-hackers-stop-yelling-at-babies-foscam#feed=%2Fauthor%2Fadriana-lee&amp;awesm=~oGpJ6LXiUDKkdw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hacks of Foscam baby monitors</a>, <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/belkin-wemo-smart-home-networks-in-danger-of-hacks/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Belkin home automation systems</a>, and hacks of smart <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/01/technology/security/car-hack/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cars systems</a> are just the beginning. As the number of intelligent devices rises, the potential damage that could be caused by lack of security will continue to increase.
		</p>,<p>
			Because IoT is a relatively new field, device developers aren’t as experienced with security principals as existing software companies. 
		</p>,<p>
			This is also true for device manufacturers, home security system providers, home automation solutions providers, and industrial systems designers—all of whom have never dealt with the threats associated with data security in networked devices.
		</p>,<p>
			For over 20 years, PKI-based solutions have been securely exchanging information across the Internet and PKI usage has skyrocketed as companies are protecting more and more data. PKI is already being used to address problems similar to the ones the Internet of Things is likely to experience, as companies are using it to secure devices like mobile phones, tablets, printers, and WiFi hotspots.
		</p>,<p>
			As a leading Certificate Authority and PKI provider, DigiCert can help secure Internet of Things devices. And as a leader in SSL innovation, DigiCert is uniquely situated to meet the security needs of individuals and organizations as they develop new technologies for Internet of Things devices.
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert already provides Internet security products and services to over 80,000 customers in more than 180 countries. Over the last decade, DigiCert’s reputation for agile and rapid solution development to meet customer needs has made us the fastest growing Certificate Authority in the world. DigiCert has increasingly become the Certificate Authority of choice for emerging markets and for data encryption security in emerging technologies.
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert already secures devices for the government and scientific community and is poised to quickly deliver the digital certificates IoT manufacturers need in order to ensure proper data protection for their customers.
		</p>,<p>
			Using the existing DigiCert Certificate Management System, manufacturers can utilize automatic issuance of digital certificates for a wide array of devices. The managed certificate system can scale from small tests to full-range deployment in mass production and enables simple management throughout the certificate lifecycle. 
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert engineers also consult with organizations to develop a custom deployment solution designed to work with their existing production infrastructures to add strong data security to their IoT devices.
		</p>,<p>
			Internet of Things device manufacturers and solutions providers can quickly begin using DigiCert managed certificate systems for Internet of things security. Where other digital certificate providers take days or weeks to set up managed accounts, DigiCert account managers can set up customers immediately—allowing you to begin deploying certificates to secure customer data and devices.

			LEHI, UT (September 4, 2014) — <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, today announced the availability of the new <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/https/"">DigiCert® Always-On SSL Site Checker</a>, a free online keyword tool to help search marketers analyze the impact SSL can have on their search rank results and determine how many competitor sites are using SSL to boost search rankings. 
		</p>,<p>
			Always-On SSL is a term that describes a practice of forcing SSL encryption by default across an entire website and not just pages where secure information is exchanged. Since Google announced on Aug. 6 that sites using SSL would receive an automatic search ranking boost, search marketers have been seeking the best way to use SSL as an advantage for site rank online.
		</p>,<p>
			Available now, the Always-On SSL checker ties into Google search APIs to produce a quick snapshot of the competitive keyword landscape and which sites already use or are migrating to HTTPS. Using the tool, a marketer can research a domain name’s current SSL status and current keywords associated with the domain, and also receive a report that includes:
		</p>,<p>
			“Google’s announcement to boost search rankings for sites using <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> is a positive step forward for user security and one that also is sure to have a long-term impact on search marketing,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “We’re mindful that the process of migrating sites to HTTPS requires search marketers to spend time learning more information about SSL certificates and evaluating how the use of SSL can improve visibility in Google search rankings. The Always-On SSL Site Checker saves marketers time by providing insights into their competitive keyword analysis with respect to how SSL is impacting search engine results.”
		</p>,<p>
			While the user security and customer engagement benefits of using Always-On SSL are recognized, Google’s new policy for search provides an added incentive for encrypting websites by boosting search rankings. For many marketers, learning how to efficiently and securely deploy certificates adds additional workload. DigiCert is introducing the new SSL site checker to help simplify the process by which organizations consider which sites to serve over HTTPS and where they can gain their greatest SEO advantage. As a value-add, the site checker provides quick links to help marketers learn how SSL works and which certificate types best suit their situation.
		</p>,<p>
			“With the growing rate of business that is done online today, it’s more important than ever that sites of all sizes take every necessary step to ensure they are optimized for good search rank positioning,” said DigiCert VP of Operations Flavio Martins.
		</p>,<p>
			Many large technology sites, including Twitter, PayPal, Facebook and Yahoo!, currently use Always-On SSL to protect their users from cross-site scripting, sidejacking and other attacks. These organizations have also reported that Always-On SSL can be achieved without measurable impacts to web speed and performance, thanks to today’s advanced computing systems. Furthermore, Always-On SSL builds trust in an organization’s brand among an increasingly security-conscious consumer base.
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert provides leading products and customer support for today’s increasingly connected world, enabling organizations to authenticate their digital identities and encrypt the data that they and their customers share online. Combining personal, timely and knowledgeable customer service with intuitive certificate management tools, DigiCert provides a five-star experience to organizations looking to optimize their security in an efficient and effective manner.

			RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. – Oct. 23, 2013 – <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sureclinical.com"">SureClinical™</a>, a leading provider of secure pharmaceutical and healthcare clinical content management solutions, announced today an exclusive partnership with <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert®</a>, a global leader in <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">authentication</a> and encryption services, to deliver the first FDA-compliant mobile signing service. The <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sureclinical.com/products/sureesign/"">SureEsign™</a> service is expected to revolutionize the way pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations handle clinical trial documentation, saving them time and money by eliminating manual paper-signing processes. 
		</p>,<p>
			Signatures created by DigiCert digital certificates can be used to verify both the source and integrity of a document. Entities using signed documents are assured the document is the original, unmodified version. DigiCert’s inclusion in the Adobe® Approved Trust List facilitates e-signing of Adobe® PDFs and the creation of digital IDs. A digital ID typically contains the signer’s name and e-mail address, the name of the organization that issued the certificate validating the ID, a serial number and an expiration date.
		</p>,<p>
			Using these certificates in connection with the SureEsign platform, a signer can execute Adobe PDF documents anytime and anywhere using SureClinical’s new, patent-pending two-factor signing authentication technology. This technology for mobile devices provides strong identification of signing parties and a highly secure environment. 
		</p>,<p>
			In the pharmaceutical market, the U.S. FDA (under FDA CFR 21 Part 11) requires digital certificate signatures on all documents submitted to its Electronic Submissions Gateway. SureEsign is the first signing service that supports FDA compliant digital certificate signing across organizational boundaries using mobile devices. SureEsign also complies with European Union Country Directives.
		</p>,<p>
			“Legacy signing solutions require companies to install and maintain expensive on-site server signing security hardware, signing software, and support services,” said SureClinical President and CEO Zack Schmidt. “These on-site signing services cannot support document signing operations beyond the firewall, limiting the use of digital certificate signing to in-house signing operations. With the new SureEsign platform, FDA clinical trial investigators, clinical research associates, sponsors and research organizations can use a mobile device to electronically sign FDA regulatory documents with their Adobe Digital ID anytime, anywhere.”  
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert’s <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/document-signing/"">document signing certificates</a> enable SureClinical to provision highly trusted digital signing services that can be viewed and verified in the latest versions of Adobe® Reader® and Adobe® Acrobat®.  		
		
		</p>,<p>
		“DigiCert is excited to be the exclusive provider of SureClinical’s document signing certificates,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “DigiCert’s experience with publicly trusted certificates and expertise in security means SureClinical is offering a secure and robust solution that is fully trusted by virtually all browsers and application software suites.”
		</p>,<p>
		Documents signed by the SureEsign platform contain a certificate credential that accurately identifies the individual signer. The signature is readily viewed and verified in SureClinical’s mobile, web or desktop clients, or in Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat. 
		</p>,<p>
		The SureEsign platform offers BioPharma and Healthcare organizations the following services:
		</p>,<p>
		•	Digital signing of office documents or medical images using highly trusted Adobe digital certificates</p>,<p>
		•	Viewing and instant validation of signed documents in Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat </p>,<p>
		•	Storage of digital IDs on U.S. NIST approved FIPS-140 level 3 compliant hardware security modules</p>,<p>
		•	Certifications for FDA, HIPAA, PCI, SSAE 16 Type II, and U.S. Safe Harbor/European Commission Privacy Directives</p>,<p>
		•	Integration of digital signing and workflow services with pharmacy and healthcare applications through the SureEsign open API

		</p>,<p>
		SureClinical’s SureEsign services are available as an optional module for the SureTrial eTMF cloud application and will be widely available beginning Q4 2013.

			LEHI, UT (February 25, 2014) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading global provider of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> and related online security products, today announced the availability of the DigiCert Certificate Inspector™. Designed to quickly find problems in certificate configuration and implementation, Certificate Inspector provides real-time analysis of an organization’s entire certificate landscape, including SSL termination endpoints. Using the tool, security professionals can discover forgotten, neglected or misconfigured certificates, and identify potential vulnerabilities, such as weak keys, problematic ciphers and expired certificates. For each potential threat detected, the tool provides a list of remediation activities.
		</p>,<p>
			SSL/TLS certificates are a key defense against unwanted surveillance of online user activity. Yet, too often system administrators fail to properly configure certificates, unknowingly leaving open vulnerabilities. Certificate Inspector scans the user’s network detecting all certificates in use, inspects SSL configuration and implementation, and then displays the results in an intuitive and interactive dashboard.
		</p>,<p>
			“By providing actionable information about certificate configuration and deployment status, combined with remediation tools, DigiCert helps organizations close the gap between certificate procurement and secure certificate deployment,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “The deployment of securely configured certificates is an important line of defense against unwelcomed surveillance. Certificate Inspector will help organizations shine a light on the areas within their network that could pose lurking threats. We believe that this tool can build upon the efforts of others in the security community to improve online trust in a new, tangible way.”
		</p>,<p>
			Keeping up with the latest security best practices as well as monitoring certificates is a daunting task, particularly for enterprises managing thousands of certificates. Frequently, manual tracking processes are used, which introduce human error and result in downtime or unknown security vulnerabilities such as configuration with cipher suites vulnerable to CRIME, BEAST, BREACH or other attacks. In other cases, departments outside of IT might deploy their own certificates, creating a blind spot for Administrators. This also can lead to configuration challenges that downgrade the effectiveness of the SSL certificates upon which organizations rely.
		</p>,<p>
			Certificate Inspector works on behalf of security professionals to bring lurking threats out of obscurity and help system administrators target and address problem areas.
		</p>,<p>
			Beginning today, security professionals can use the Certificate Inspector to:
			</p>,<p>
			Using a proprietary algorithm, the Certificate Inspector analyzes SSL certificates and termination endpoints for many security factors, including:
			</p>,<p>
			For each SSL certificate and termination endpoint, administrators receive a vulnerability report, a corresponding grade and a quick list of best practices for mitigating discovered weaknesses.
		</p>,<p>
			“The Certificate Inspector is just one of many steps that DigiCert is taking to improve online trust and help organizations best protect their data in motion,” said Hales. “With the input of our customers and others interested in optimum security, we’re working hard to provide the best SSL customer experience possible and advance internet security best practices.”

			LEHI, UT (Sept. 17, 2014) —<a href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, today released a free tool which helps system administrators analyze their use of SHA-1 hashing algorithms across all domains and subdomains—and map out a path for SHA-2 migration. Google’s Aug. 19 announcement that it would accelerate deprecation of SHA-1 certificates, including giving untrusted warnings to sites with SHA-1 certificates that expire in 2016, makes it necessary for many administrators to migrate to <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/transitioning-to-sha-2.htm"">SHA-2</a> by as early as November or risk their customers receiving downgraded trust indicators in Chrome.
		</p>,<p>
			Using the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/sha1-sunset/"">DigiCert® SHA-1 Sunset Tool</a>, administrators can determine validity periods for their SHA-1 <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> and receive information about how Google’s new policy will affect user interaction with these certificates. DigiCert issues new certificates with SHA-2 by default and has done so for nearly a year. For those choosing to migrate their existing SHA-1 to a new DigiCert-issued SHA-2 certificate, DigiCert will provide a free replacement matching the length of the existing certificate licensing term, regardless of whether or not they are a DigiCert customer.  
		</p>,<p>
			“With the busy holiday shopping season nearing and the threat of a downgraded user trust experience looming for Chrome users, DigiCert is taking extra steps to help ease the burden of accelerated SHA-2 migration timelines for administrators,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “Our new SHA-1 Sunset Tool saves time and effort by providing a comprehensive analysis of an organization’s certificate landscape, including where SHA-1 certificates exist, which software and hardware support SHA-2, and a review of how Google’s new timelines may affect any given site. We also understand that SHA-2 migration involves costly system and device upgrades for organizations and so we’re offering to match for free the remaining term of any existing SHA-1 certificate that is converted to SHA-2.” 
		</p>,<p>
			Some key timelines are important to keep in mind regarding Google's SHA-1 deprecation:
		</p>,<p>
			<span style=""color:red;"">Updated:</span> Additionally, Microsoft has announced the following SHA-1 deprecation timelines:

        </p>,<p>
			In addition to receiving a full report of their current SHA-1 deployment across all domains via the SHA-1 Sunset Tool, administrators can take advantage of other DigiCert tools and features to optimize their certificate deployment. DigiCert customers can use a built-in feature to their customer accounts to monitor SHA-2 migrations as they take place, in real-time, using the SHA-1 Sunset Tool. They also can use their account to issue new certificates and benefit from free reissues at any time. Non-DigiCert customers can access the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/cert-inspector.htm"">DigiCert Certificate Inspector</a> to review real-time SSL certificate and endpoint deployment across internal and external networks and identify areas for improvement, including flagging SHA-1 certificates and expiration dates.

			LEHI, UT (Oct. 9, 2014) — <a href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, today announced the availability of new <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/wifi/"">SecureWifi Certificates</a>, which are trusted by the Wi-Fi Alliance to authenticate and encrypt online signup servers compliant with Release 2 of its Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Passpoint program. As one of just two certificate authorities included in Release 2 of the Passpoint certification program for devices, DigiCert is a full-service provider and provides certificates to Wi-Fi chipset manufacturers, service providers, and access point vendors looking to participate in Passpoint. Additionally, authorized certificates from DigiCert can help retail and hospitality providers deploy Passpoint-certified networks at retail and hotel locations around the world.
		</p>,<p>
			“Today’s announcement is an important step toward the future and ultimate realization of secure Wi-Fi being made available everywhere,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “With Passpoint Release 2, equipment manufacturers and vendors can build the next-generation systems that will enable secure online connections for new account provisioning, authentication for Wi-Fi hotspots to reduce the risk of spoofing, and an overall improved, more secure Wi-Fi user experience.”
		</p>,<p>
			Passpoint Release 2 features closes some of the traditional gaps in hotspot security by provisioning online signup servers with an authorized digital certificate to authenticate the access point with the service provider’s uniquely identifying common name and the provider’s logo. This helps avoid user confusion and reduces the likelihood of a user falling prey to access point spoofing. Additionally, the use of an authorized certificate encrypts information exchanged during the signup process, helping to protect user’s credentials when registering for a new account.
		</p>,<p>
			By streamlining the process for creating a new user account at the point of access, Passpoint helps to reduce barriers to account creation and usage for service providers. Likewise, it reduces the complexity for users in getting connected and enables them to re-connect easily across a service provider’s broad network of hotspots with the trust that their credentials are securely exchanged when connecting.
		</p>,<p>
			The availability of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/wifi/how-wifi-certificates-work.htm"">SecureWifi Certificates</a>, and subsequent work that DigiCert plans within the Wi-Fi Alliance in the coming future, represent an important step forward toward a vision of enabling secure wi-fi everywhere. With continued advancements in future Passpoint programs, the potential exists to enable globally available, authenticated hotspot access points and devices that are easily identifiable and provisioned with end-to-end encryption. It also provides a path forward that may lead to expansion of global Wi-Fi roaming that reduces cellular data overload and demand for new cellular tower construction.
		</p>,<p>
			Mobile equipment vendors, operators and hospitality providers looking to participate in Release 2 features of the Passpoint program need to use an authorized digital certificate for certification. As the only publicly trusted Certificate Authority authorized for Release 2 of Passpoint, DigiCert invites participants to experience the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/welcome/why-choose-digicert.htm"">DigiCert Difference</a>™, which includes award-winning customer support, a host of products and tools to simplify and optimize digital certificate management, and fast negotiation of secure sessions designed for the speed of mobile business.

			LEHI, UT (Dec. 18, 2014) —<a href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, has been selected by the GÉANT Association as its exclusive provider of <a href=""/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> for its members for at least the next two years. The GÉANT Association’s announcement follows a tender process that began in early 2014.
		</p>,<p>
			“After careful consideration of the many requirements the GÉANT Association has voiced on behalf of its customers, DigiCert clearly stood out as the preferred partner for the coming years,” stated the GÉANT Association’s announcement. “The GÉANT Association selected DigiCert based on its proven ability to deliver a wide range of certificate types, provide rapid validation services, and a sophisticated, yet flexible certificate portal.

            LEHI, UT (April 14, 2015) — DigiCert, a leader in <a href=""/ssl-certificate.htm"" target=""_blank"">SSL Certificate</a> trust, today is announcing new ways to automate SSL certificate installation and server configuration while helping enterprises detect certificate fraud. Certificate Monitoring parses data from Google Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and proprietary DigiCert systems to give enterprises unparalleled insight into certificates issued for their domains, along with phishing detection. Express Install, unlike any other utility available, simplifies and automates SSL installation and server configuration for Windows servers and top Linux distributions.
        </p>,<p>
            <a href=""/certificate-monitoring/"" target=""_blank"">Certificate Monitoring</a> identifies and helps stop unauthorized SSL Certificates and protects brand IP by providing a comprehensive overview of all SSL Certificates issued for a given domain and its variants. Using Certificate Monitoring, organizations enter owned domains (and variants) to identify unauthorized SSL Certificates and possible phishing attempts. Administrators can receive e-mail alerts when certificates are issued for their domains. Certificate Monitoring is the first operational service of its type in the market, in part available because DigiCert operates the only non-Google, approved CT log.
        </p>,<p>
            Created with the system administrator or IT manager in mind, DigiCert's <a href=""/express-install/"" target=""_blank"">Express Install</a> automates the installation and configuration of SSL Certificates, reducing the complexity, hassle, and time to enable HTTPS. It also reduces the typical configuration errors associated with manual processes. Unlike any tool now or planned to become available on the market, Express Install is compatible with Windows servers and top Linux distributions for Apache server support. Express Install also supports all certificate types, including wildcard, multi-domain and EV SSL.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Our express installation and certificate monitoring systems are the result of continued efforts to enhance online trust while also addressing our customers' needs for consolidated, simplified certificate lifecycle management,"" said DigiCert Chief Security Officer Jason Sabin. ""Certificate Monitoring and Express Install give administrators insight into the security of their domains, and also replace many of the time-consuming and error-prone tasks related to certificate installation and management.""
        </p>,<p>
            Consistent with its quest to simplify the process of enabling Always-on SSL, DigiCert Express Install reduces installation and server configuration to a matter of clicks. Using Express Install eliminates the barriers and complexities of setting up secure servers and HTTPS-enabled Websites.
        </p>,<p>
            Now in beta, the DigiCert CertCentral™ platform consolidates enterprise certificate management, with Certificate Monitoring, Express Install and the award-winning DigiCert Certificate Inspector™, which helps organizations quickly inventory all SSL certificates across internal and external networks. Using smart sensors, Certificate Inspector helps identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities and non-compliant certificates, and also provides remediation tips. Together, these new features from DigiCert represent a major step forward for online trust and digital certificate management.

            San Francisco, CA (April 23, 2015) — DigiCert's continued quest to make <a href=""/lifecycle/"" target=""_blank"">SSL Certificate management</a> easier and more secure continues to gain notice, as the company took home two awards at the 11th Annual Global Excellence Awards this week, held during the annual RSA Conference. DigiCert was named a gold winner for Best Support Department of the Year, and the <a href=""/cert-inspector.htm"" target=""_blank"">DigiCert Certificate Inspector™</a> was named a bronze winner in the Best Vulnerability Assessment, Remediation and Management Solution category.
        </p>,<p>
            Since its founding, DigiCert has maintained a core mission of helping organizations more efficiently, securely and effectively manage the critical SSL/TLS certificate lifecycle, while reducing the barriers of making the web more secure. As network and application-level attacks continue to rise and consumers grow increasingly concerned about their data security and privacy, DigiCert is helping enterprises of all sizes simplify and automate SSL deployment, inventory their SSL landscape, and protect against fraud and insecure server configuration.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Our company was founded by a developer who had grown frustrated with how difficult ordering and installing a digital certificate can be, and who determined that there should be a better way,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""Our innovative security solutions, like Certificate Inspector, are built on the feedback we’ve received from our customers. This system gives enterprises unparalleled access into their real-time certificate landscape and helps them identify problem areas caused by misconfiguration and other deployment errors.""
        </p>,<p>
            Continued Sabin, ""Certificate Inspector and our focus on free, 24/7 expert customer support are just part of what sets DigiCert apart and makes us the top choice for enterprises who understand the value and importance of HTTPS-enabled communications.""

            LEHI, UT (June 4, 2015) — DigiCert, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, has partnered with Plex, the leading personal media streaming solution, to provide publicly trusted certificates to enhance security for all Plex media streaming and cloud services. DigiCert's SSL/TLS Internet of Things (IoT) solution will allow Plex to provide end-to-end security for tens of millions of Plex media servers and clients.
        </p>,<p>
            ""With the rapid expansion of supported devices and significant user growth, security is a top priority for Plex,"" said Plex Chief Product Officer Scott Olechowski. ""Times have changed.

"<p>
            LEHI, UT (January 19, 2016) — DigiCert, a global SSL Certification Authority (CA) and the leading provider of trusted certificate management solutions, announced that its certificate platform <a href=""/certcentral/"" target=""_blank"">CertCentral</a><sup>®</sup> has been named a finalist for Internet of Things (IoT) Security Product Excellence. Winners will be announced at the Info Security Products Guide's 12<sup>th</sup> Annual Global Excellence Awards, to be held on February 29 in San Francisco, in conjunction with the start of the annual RSA security conference.
        </p>,<p>
            CertCentral handles all aspects of the digital <a href=""/lifecycle/"" target=""_blank"">certificate management</a> lifecycle in one intuitive, cloud-based portal that is capable of supporting active deployment of billions of certificates simultaneously. A rapidly increasing number of major IoT companies are using the platform to embed security into current and next-generation internet-connected products.
        </p>,<p>
            ""The IoT demands smart, optimized security solutions at enormous scales, and CertCentral does this for organizations by simplifying certificate management and automating critical tasks,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""We're honored by this recognition and excited about the growing number of popular IoT platforms, manufacturers, and leading organizations that are working with us to authenticate and encrypt smart devices and systems to gain a competitive edge.""
        </p>,<p>
            The IoT era spurs exponential growth in the number of connected devices and objects but also increases the attack vector for malicious parties looking to exploit the lack of basic security controls such as authentication and encryption. According to Gartner, ""public key infrastructure (PKI) will re-emerge as one of the most relevant authentication mechanisms for organizations to address the IOT authentication problem. PKI's flexibility is important when changing requirements and represent identity in a cross-platform, multiprotocol approach...Gartner predicts that discovery, provisioning, authentication and data protection will account for half of all security spend in the next five years."" <sup>1</sup>
        </p>,<p>
            To fulfill its promise, the IoT market must implement PKI correctly. Episodes such as Heartbleed serve as reminders of the importance of enterprises not only deploying digital certificates at-scale but being ready to execute real-time updates of all TLS termination points across the network.
        </p>,<p>
            DigiCert's CertCentral helps organizations maximize their IoT brand investments by simplifying certificate deployment and management through automation and best-in-class innovation. CertCentral automation and real-time insights help reduce human errors and the hours spent on manual processes. CertCentral closes the security gaps often caused by negligence, ignorance or rogue actions of employees not authorized to issue certificates by IT.
        </p>,<p>
            CertCentral addresses all aspects of the certificate management lifecycle, including:
        </p>,<p>
            With OCSP response times for TLS/SSL Certificates more than four times faster than competitors, DigiCert certificates are the clear choice for performance-minded enterprises working in the IoT. As a result, DigiCert continues to attract the business of the world's leading brands, including six of the global Alexa Top 10, major IoT platform providers and global technology companies.

            LEHI, UT (May 19, 2016) — DigiCert, a global <a href=""/ssl-certificate.htm"" target=""_blank"">SSL</a> Certification Authority (CA) and the leading provider of trusted certificate management solutions, continues to invest in the industry's fastest OCSP response times that help organizations using its certificates bridge the gap between performance and security. This translates to more secure Internet of Things (IoT) and web deployments, enabling fast page and application load times with reliable certificate verification.
        </p>,<p>
            Recent reports from Netcraft show that DigiCert OCSP response times are up to eight times faster than the average response across the CA industry.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Digital certificates are growing in use as a critical backbone to ensuring web user privacy and security by authenticating websites, smart devices and <a href=""/internet-of-things/"" target=""_blank"">IoT</a> deployments, and encrypting data in transit,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""The need for speedy but secure deployments increases as businesses look to grow their consumer base via mobile and IoT deployments. Fast OCSP served over the edge helps to meet consumer expectations of nearly instantaneous page loads while providing essential security.""
        </p>,<p>
            DigiCert enables fast certificate verification checking by working with leading content distribution networks (CDNs) to serve OCSP responses over the edge. The company also geolocates OCSP response servers to shorten the distance that validation checks need to travel, helping assure consistently fast, secure page loads anywhere in the world.
        </p>,<p>
            In addition to enabling the IoT, DigiCert's <a href=""https://blog.digicert.com/ocsp-times-and-what-they-mean-for-you/"" target=""_blank"">fast OCSP</a> response times are supporting collaborative research initiatives made possible by international grid supercomputing. Fast, secure connections are key to researchers being able to collaborate in real-time via connected networks. Large-scale, certificate-based authentication and encryption helps researchers across multiple global universities and labs confidently share key findings and work together to solve some of the world's most pressing issues.
        </p>,<p>
            A few of the projects supported by DigiCert-secured grids include the Large Hadron Collider, cancer research, deep space exploration via the European Space Agency's Copernicus program, studies examining glacier melt and the effects of climate change, and collaboration to improve economic development across geopolitical boundaries.
        </p>,<p>
            ""DigiCert has a singular focus on enhancing online trust and reliability in all forms, including working to ensure our server infrastructure supports expanding web use cases,"" said DigiCert CTO Dan Timpson. ""We look at each day as an opportunity to improve, and we’re driven by the many important initiatives that our efforts support, as increasingly innovative organizations are partnering with DigiCert to enable PKI protections for their next-generation projects.""
        </p>,<p>
            DigiCert has successfully tested its optimized infrastructure to support billions of digital certificates with fast OCSP response times, as required by current and future IoT developments.

            LEHI, UT (September 27, 2016) — DigiCert, a global leader in trusted identity and authentication services for enterprise web and Internet of Things (IoT) security, today announced a full integration with Microsoft Azure Key Vault. Azure clients can now issue high volumes of DigiCert SSL/TLS certificates directly through their Azure platform, where their private keys are stored with encryption at rest, while supporting automatic renewal of certificates before expiry.
        </p>,<p>
            ""DigiCert is focused on working with leading platform providers like Microsoft Azure to assist developers in streamlining their efforts to ensure data is safe in the cloud,"" said DigiCert CTO Dan Timpson. ""By integrating our TLS certificate issuance processes with Azure Key Vault we can simplify certificate management and improve private key security.""
        </p>,<p>
            ""Microsoft Azure Key Vault benefits developers by providing the security tools they need to encrypt data and provide trusted connections,"" said Nicole Herskowitz, senior director of product marketing, Microsoft Azure. ""We are pleased to see that DigiCert's integration with Azure Key Vault benefits our mutual customers with enhanced security.""
        </p>,<p>
            Azure's automated engine works seamlessly with DigiCert's highly available APIs to simplify certificate management. Developers can issue high volumes of DigiCert high-assurance certificates directly through their Azure Key Vault account, and the certificates are automatically renewed prior to expiration. Through the integration, certificate private keys are stored securely in Key Vault providing virtual access to Key Vault HSMs. This provides an added layer of security for keys with encryption at rest, enabling HSM protection without the cost of purchasing and maintaining hardware on premise. Additionally, users can enjoy the improved performance and reduced latency of cloud applications.
        </p>,<p>
            To get started, developers must have an Azure account and a DigiCert CertCentral<sup>®</sup> account with an associated API key. The API key integrates succinctly with Key Vault.
        </p>,<p>
            Developers can take advantage of this integration today. To learn more about how to activate a DigiCert account or order DigiCert certificates through Azure Key Vault, visit <a href=""/azure-key-vault/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.digicert.com/azure-key-vault/</a>.

            Each year, the Honor Roll audits the top online retailers, FDIC banks, consumer services, media/news outlets and U.S. federal government sites to determine adoption of online security and privacy best practices. For its part, DigiCert not only advocates high standards for SSL/TLS authentication and encryption but also follows strict security practices for its own systems.
        </p>,<p>
            ""OTA commends DigiCert not only for achieving the Honor Roll for the fifth consecutive year, but more importantly, its commitment to collaboration in both the public and private sector"", said Online Trust Alliance CEO and Executive Director Craig Spiezle. ""Through DigiCert's support of OTA and active participation in industry working groups, the company continues to help re-define site security and responsible privacy practices.""
        </p>,<p>
            The increasing connectivity of global economies associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) is adding urgency for organizations to ensure strong device authentication and encryption of data in transit. This includes networked medical devices, home automation systems, manufacturing, industrial operations, automobiles and other critical infrastructure. Public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital certificates help limit device access to the authorized parties and ensure message integrity through secure signing services. Certificates also authenticate secure bootup, enrollment and updates to IoT devices. DigiCert's combination of smart automation to simplify certificate management with high-assurance identity validation helps lead to a more trustworthy IoT and web.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Connected devices and systems are expanding rapidly, but too many times they fail to implement proper authentication, encryption and messaging signing to ensure trust and integrity of data,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""The OTA Honor Roll is an important annual benchmark to help companies measure up to the high standards that are required for a safe web and economy. It also aids consumers by giving them insight into the organizations that most value their security and privacy. DigiCert is honored to be recognized for our efforts to uphold the highest standards in data and system protection and to support OTA's efforts to raise the bar for all industries.""
        </p>,<p>
            Now in its eighth year, the Online Trust Audit and Honor Roll is the only comprehensive, independent online trust benchmarking study. The Honor Roll surveys more than 400 million e-mail headers, 1,000 privacy policies and approximately 10,000 web pages. Benchmarking the security and privacy practices of top private and public sector websites, the Honor Roll evaluates important security hygiene practices including <a href=""/ssl-certificate.htm"" target=""_blank"">SSL certificate</a>/TLS implementation, privacy policies, e-mail authentication, and use of <a href=""/ev-ssl-certification.htm"" target=""_blank"">Extended Validation SSL Certificates</a>.
        </p>,<p>
            Started in 2008 as an effort to drive adoption of best practices, its objectives are to 1) recognize leadership and commitment to best practices which aid in the protection of online trust and confidence in online services, 2) enable businesses to enhance their security, data protection and privacy practices, 3) move from compliance to stewardship, demonstrating support of meaningful self-regulation, and 4) promote security &amp; privacy as part of a company's brand promise and value proposition.
        </p>,<p>
            The Online Trust Alliance (OTA) is a non-profit with the mission to enhance online trust and user empowerment while promoting innovation and the vitality of the Internet. Its goal is to help educate businesses, policy makers and stakeholders while developing and advancing best practices and tools to enhance the protection of users' security, privacy and identity. OTA supports collaborative public-private partnerships, benchmark reporting, and meaningful self-regulation and data stewardship. Its members and supporters include leaders spanning the public policy, technology, ecommerce, social networking, mobile, email and interactive marketing, financial, service provider, government agency and industry organization sectors.

			LINDON, UT (August 3, 2010) - DigiCert, Inc., a leading provider of Authentication &amp; Encryption services, now offers Managed Public Key Infrastructure 
			(PKI),
			a service that empowers customers who require a high SSL certificate volume to take control of certificate management. Managed PKI allows organizations to 
			perform key life-cycle events of SSL certificates on demand.
		</p>,<p>	
			SSL certificates encrypt the transfer of sensitive online information and protect that information from outside parties. From online shopping to secure 
			email messages or even private health records, SSL certificates have a wide variety of applications in any industry. 
		</p>,<p>	
			With DigiCert's Managed PKI service, issuing new SSL certificates and reissuing, replacing, or revoking existing certificates is instantaneous since both
			the organization and the domain are pre-validated. Organizations can now efficiently manage their certificates without the wait normally associated with 
			retail certificate orders. 
		</p>,<p>	
			Managed PKI allows customers to have multiple sub-accounts, thus distributing workload while centralizing control. Designated Administrative Users can submit 
			certificate requests and also approve or reject requests submitted by Limited Users. Authority levels for users can be changed at any time and customers 
			can set up as many Administrative Users as needed, therefore increasing certificate issuing speeds. Additionally, business units can be created so that 
			certificate requests can be associated with organizational departments, such as Sales or Marketing, for internal auditing or billing procedures.
		</p>,<p>	
			Certificate sub-accounts can also be shared among business units. If a business unit, such as Marketing, needs access to test.example.com and there is an existing 
			certificate for that domain issued to Sales, then an Administrative User can give Marketing access to that existing certificate without having to create a new account. 
			All account activity is recorded in an audit log so that every action is tracked with pertinent details that are searchable by user or by date.
		</p>,<p>	
			""DigiCert's Managed PKI service is a huge time saver, both for me as an Administrative User and for the users I support,"" says Brian Wilson, Network 
			Security Engineer at SAS. ""The workflow features have been particularly welcome. For example, the ability to assign multiple owners - which means a 
			certificate can be renewed even when its original creator is not available - reduces headaches and delays. DigiCert not only costs us less, but it 
			provides a better MPKI experience than our previous provider.""
		</p>,<p>	
			Funds are deposited into Managed PKI accounts by purchase order or credit card and treated like cash. All approved certificate requests are 
			automatically deducted from the account balance and the deposited funds never expire. In addition to these great features, Managed PKI users 
			enjoy all the benefits of being a DigiCert customer: free 24-hour support, free reissues, unlimited server licensing, low prices, and much more.
		</p>,<p>	
			According to Augustus Sam, Senior Network Engineer at the University of Maryland, DigiCert's Managed PKI has been a great benefit. ""Managed PKI from 
			DigiCert is a great fit for our university,"" Sam said. ""We get to keep the extremely helpful and responsive support that DigiCert is known for while 
			also gaining the ability to manage our certificates as we choose. The online system is easy to use and has simplified everything for us. Managed PKI 
			is smart, fast, and extremely affordable.""
		</p>,<p>	
			SSL Plus, Unified Communications (SAN), and Extended Validation (EV) certificates are all available and manageable from the Managed PKI system. 
			DigiCert strives to provide the best products and service possible to its customers, and Managed PKI further helps to achieve that goal. DigiCert is 
			also dedicated to providing free tools that enable administrators to get the most out of its high-strength encryption. Robust security controls and 
			strict adherence to SSL standards, all verified by WebTrust, combined with strong encryption, solidify DigiCert's position as a leading provider of 
			authentication and encryption services. To find out more about Managed PKI or to request a complimentary demonstration, visit

            LAS VEGAS, NV (Nov. 19, 2015) — Security is getting better as awareness improves and organizations invest more in protecting data, but the industry needs further collaboration to improve the usability of security solutions for enterprises and end-users. That was the predominant theme security experts told attendees at the annual DigiCert Security Summit, held in Las Vegas Nov. 12 and 13. Conference-goers gathered to discuss best practices for Internet of Things (IoT), enterprise, cloud and browser security. Discussions included the essential role of public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital <a href=""/lifecycle/lifecycle-features.htm"" target=""_blank"">certificate management</a> in protecting the massive amounts of data traversing the Internet in the IoT market.
        </p>,<p>
            Cigital Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and co-founder of the Building Security in Maturity Model (BSIMM) Gary McGraw told the audience that the rules have changed, as there is no defined perimeter in cloud computing models, but that he is optimistic in the growing investment in 'security by design' within organizations. Meanwhile, security researcher and TOR contributor Runa Sandvik emphasized the need for better user education and simplification of security in her efforts to help journalists protect their sources. Sandvik said these principles apply to all endeavors to secure connected communications.
        </p>,<p>
            ""If we want people to be safer online, we need to find tools and methods that already fit within users' workflows,"" said Sandvik. ""If we try to force them to change how they work, they won't use it.""
        </p>,<p>
            Many of the discussions at the Security Summit focused on protecting data in the era of the <a href=""/internet-of-things/iot-security-challenge.htm"" target=""_blank"">IoT</a>, as the number of connected objects and devices is expected to increase exponentially in the next five years. DigiCert Chief Security Officer (CSO) Jason Sabin spoke of the company's investment in helping organizations efficiently deploy and manage large quantities of digital certificates to provide strong device authentication and encryption of data in transit.
        </p>,<p>
            ""The IoT introduces a new scale for security, one that we're prepared to help organizations efficiently implement,"" said Sabin. ""We've successfully tested our systems to handle deployment of billions of certificates. As the first to operate a Google Certificate Transparency log, our platforms have access to monitor 35 million certificates, giving organizations real-time access to their entire certificate landscape, to make sure they are following best practices and optimizing their deployments and configurations.""
        </p>,<p>
            One of the areas most affected by the IoT is healthcare, where the consequences of connecting networked medical devices with inherent security flaws, or devices that are not properly configured, may prove more catastrophic than in other industries. At the Security Summit, DigiCert brought together a panel featuring Protiviti Associate Director Scott Erven, a security researcher who has spent several years researching medical device vulnerabilities, alongside Royal Philips Global Product Security &amp; Services Officer Michael McNeil, and GE Healthcare Principal Security Consultant Dan Birtwhistle. The panel, moderated by DigiCert VP of Healthcare Solutions Mike Nelson, also included Plex Founder &amp; Chief Product Officer Scott Olechowski, who addressed his company's recent work to provide TLS protection to all of its customers, <a href=""/news/2015-06-04-plex-partners-with-digicert.htm"" target=""_blank"">deploying certificates across tens of millions of devices and servers</a>.
        </p>,<p>
            Erven told conference attendees that securing networked medical devices is a shared responsibility between device manufacturers and the healthcare clinics, hospitals and other facilities that use them.
        </p>,<p>
            McNeil and Birtwhistle both emphasized that manufacturers are prioritizing security and addressing areas of improvement. They said that security is good for business and is now becoming part of the procurement requirements they see from healthcare organizations.
        </p>,<p>
            Erven said device manufacturers have to balance device functionality with security considerations and that sometimes these considerations make for tough decisions. The involvement of large manufacturers in providing responsible vulnerability disclosure policies is a positive step in the right direction.
        </p>,<p>
            Improving browser security begins with focusing on basic certificate implementation errors, according to Google Software Engineer Emily Stark, who spoke at the Security Summit. Stark told attendees that 17 percent of certificate errors in Chrome happen when users have bad clocks on their machines. This includes buggy antivirus software that often alters operating system clocks upon install. Additionally, many organizations' certificates fail because they include mismatched names in their certificate chains – something free online checkers such as the <a href=""/help/"" target=""_blank"">DigiCert SSL Installation Tool</a> can detect.
        </p>,<p>
            Stark also spoke about projects such as Google Certificate Transparency (CT) and Public Key Pinning that improve online trust. She highlighted new information to be provided in the developer tools security panel in upcoming versions of Chrome as well as new security warning messages.
        </p>,<p>
            Continuing on this theme, White Ops Chief Scientist and researcher Dan Kaminsky demonstrated practical security improvements in the browser to, for the 'first time' in his career, defeat clickjacking attacks. Kaminsky said, ""This is the anti-hack. Security is working for the browser instead of against it.""
        </p>,<p>
            To keep up with evolving security threats, industry must collaborate to strengthen policies, improve trustworthiness and introduce new technologies that meet the needs of the IoT and emerging markets, said DigiCert Vice President of Business Development &amp; Legal Jeremy Rowley at the Security Summit. Rowley spoke of several industry initiatives advanced by DigiCert to improve security, including leading the industry in implementing Google's CT in the company's systems and operating the first independent log trusted by Google. The DigiCert log recently captured a large case of certificate misissuance that was publicized by Google. DigiCert is pushing for CT logging to be required for DV and OV certificates as well.
        </p>,<p>
            Rowley also mentioned DigiCert's support for Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA), which allows domain operators to specify which CAs they trust to issue for their domains, and a recent ballot proposed by DigiCert in the CA/Browser Forum to allow for so-called short-lived certificates. Rowley highlighted industry advancements led by Microsoft to enhance requirements for code signing certificates and software publishing houses storing and using private keys.
        </p>,<p>
            Blue Coat Systems Senior Principal Security Architect Tammy Green spoke of recent misuses of cryptography and the need for better understanding and implementation by administrators, stating that most of the recent issues have not been with the algorithms themselves but rather with poor implementation. Green highlighted the need to ensure entropy.
        </p>,<p>
            Rackspace Security Intrapreneur Jarret Raim spoke about increasing the use of encryption in the cloud. Meanwhile, OpenDNS Director of Security Engineering Tom Hash and Technical Manager of Site Reliability Engineering for Adobe Eric Stevenson spoke about using digital certificates in a way that protects, and even advances, operational excellence within dynamic content serving environments.
        </p>,<p>
            Enterprises are not left alone to be the experts in deploying these critical technologies. DigiCert helps simplify large-scale management of digital certificates across the enterprise, and ensures strong authentication and encryption for the IoT. Smart, automated certificate management solutions can help fill these gaps.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Express, automated installation and real-time certificate monitoring and inspection provide organizations the scalabilities, efficiencies and real-time insights into their systems that make strong security of devices and data in motion feasible,"" said DigiCert's Sabin. ""Leading organizations know that device authentication and data encryption are must-haves for the IoT era, and we have the platforms and expertise they are seeking to ensure consumer trust and secure the investments they are making for the future.""

            SANTA MONICA, Calif., (December 13, 2016) — Today, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.airmap.com"">AirMap</a> announced Drone ID, a partnership with <a target=""_blank"" href=""/"">DigiCert</a> that will enable, for the first time, instant authentication of an unmanned aircraft's identity via a digital certificate.  Drone ID is a major step forward for drone security, laying the groundwork for a future in which millions of drones can share the airspace safely and efficiently.
        </p>,<p>
            Drone ID is a publicly-trusted SSL/TLS certificate issued by AirMap and DigiCert. Drone operators that register their drone online will receive a digital Drone ID certificate, including a unique, validated aircraft identity number that can be loaded onto the drone and shared with others in the drone ecosystem. Drone ID will first be available for drones built with the <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.intel.com/aero"">Intel® Aero Platform for Developers</a>, including the Intel Aero Ready to Fly Drone.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Think of Drone ID like any form of identification you have in your wallet,"" AirMap Chief Information Security Officer Jared Ablon said. ""If you show your driver's license at airport security, they don't need to call the DMV to verify. Drone ID works the same way, providing drones with an aircraft identity that has been authenticated by trusted authorities.""
        </p>,<p>
            Drone ID is the first program of its kind, and a necessary step towards achieving efficient and secure communication from drone to drone, between drones and other aircraft, and with platforms providing airspace information and services. When an aircraft with Drone ID shares its identity, there is no need to query a third party to verify, enabling more efficient data exchange between airspace stakeholders.
        </p>,<p>
            Drone ID will be certified by AirMap and DigiCert, a security solutions provider that provides scalable identity, authentication and encryption for web servers and other connected devices. DigiCert provides high-volume certificate issuance and management for leading organizations in healthcare, technology, industrial operations, finance, manufacturing, education, transportation, telecommunications and government.
        </p>,<p>
            ""AirMap's partnership with DigiCert brings a new level of security to the drone ecosystem,"" AirMap CTO Daniel Rubio said. ""Identity verification – delivered by Drone ID – is a critical part of the airspace infrastructure that will support drone operations at scale and bring countless benefits to our everyday lives.""
        </p>,<p>
            ""The growing number of connected devices in our world requires scalable security solutions that use identity, strong authentication and encryption,"" said DigiCert CTO Dan Timpson. ""Our work with AirMap is advancing secure drone operations and aircraft safety into a new era and is part of our focus across all industries to serve the security needs of new and emerging markets, including the Internet of Things.""

            LAS VEGAS, NV, (February 6, 2017) — DigiCert, a global leader in scalable authentication and encryption solutions, unveiled DigiCert Auto-Provisioning, powered by Device Authority, this past weekend at the DigiCert Security Summit. With Auto-Provisioning, connected device manufacturers and owners can provision digital certificates at scale, whether their devices use open standards such as SCEP or EST, or only support propriety device enrollment protocols.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Device authentication and encryption are critical to securing connected devices and the information they share, but many software implementations lack standard protocols for provisioning devices,"" said DigiCert CTO Dan Timpson. ""DigiCert Auto-Provisioning, powered by Device Authority, helps companies get certificates on a much wider range of IoT devices in a scalable, secure and automated way.""
        </p>,<p>
            As the number of connected devices rises toward an estimated 50 billion by 2020, security continues to lag behind. A study published by HP Fortify estimated that three-quarters of connected devices failed to encrypt communications to the Internet and local network. Last year, researchers found that Nissan Leaf smartphone app APIs were not authenticating users on the server. Similarly, in 2015, researchers highlighted a flaw in Samsung’s smart fridge that attackers could use to carry out a man-in-the-middle attack and access a homeowner's credentials.
        </p>,<p>
            In healthcare, the FDA has recently issued ""Postmarket Management of Cyber Security in Medical Devices,"" even as security vulnerabilities have been discovered in popular pacemakers, defibrillators and diabetes insulin pumps. The report calls for ""deploying mitigations that address cyber risk early."" Public key infrastructure (PKI) can be used for secure boot, patch management, machine-to-machine mutual authentication, user authentication, and data integrity to help prevent unauthorized intrusions and data manipulation.
        </p>,<p>
            IoT devices often lack the compute power required for strong encryption and do not have the ability to securely generate and store keys required for strong device security. Similarly, when credentials need to be revoked or rotated because of device authorization changes, the process is typically manual, time-consuming and vulnerable to human error. DigiCert Auto-Provisioning combines scalable certificate issuance with automated provisioning to simplify large-volume device enrollment and credentialing. It also provides secure key generation and storage to prevent the use of stolen credentials and unauthorized devices.
        </p>,<p>
            DigiCert Auto-Provisioning expands the range and type of IoT devices that can be secured, enabling certificate deployment and management at scale through:
        </p>,<p>
            Concluded Timpson, ""Companies now have the ability to assert owner-controlled PKI on a much wider spectrum of connected devices to strengthen security controls. Using this solution, companies can take a major step forward in securing their IoT investments, becoming less dependent on manufacturer security.""

""Our growing partnership with Cybertrust Japan will help more Japanese businesses enjoy in their own language the market leadership, automated certificate management and industry-best customer support that many of the world's leading brands count on DigiCert to provide.""
        </p>,<p>

As part of the growing partnership, Cybertrust Japan will operate a local Registration Authority (RA) to improve certificate issuance processes for in-market customers.
        </p>,<p>
            Cybertrust Japan is the longest-tenured certificate issuer in Japan with more than 20 years in business. For the past two consecutive years, the company has enjoyed the largest net increase in the number of EV certificates issued in Japan. Cybertrust Japan has experienced significant gains, thanks in large part to DigiCert's strong reputation and leading certificate management tools.

Therefore, it is possible that the pages would still load with a padlock in the browser.

            January 5, 2009 -- On December 30, 2008 a group of security researchers reported that by exploiting a known weakness in the MD5 hashing algorithm, they were able to create a rogue intermediate CA certificate under the ""Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1"" root certificate, belonging to GeoTrust's RapidSSL brand.
        </p>,<p>
            Because all certificates issued by DigiCert use the SHA-1 standard, we are happy to reassure all our past, present, and future customers that these findings do not present any reason for them to worry about the integrity of their DigiCert SSL certificates.
            The fact that DigiCert uses SHA-1 instead of the outdated MD5, along with various other internal controls, makes the attack by <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/#sec5"" target=""blank"">the MD5 researchers</a> impossible.
	</p>,<p>The recent findings also highlight the problems inherent in the practice of issuing domain validated certificates, which can be issued automatically, with no human element in the verification process.
	
	Though frequently the companies that issue these ""rapid,"" ""instant,"" ""low assurance,"" or ""automated"" certificates tout the speed with which SSL certificates can be issued, these certificates provide no assurance that the certificate belongs to a real company.</p>,<p>To protect our customers, DigiCert issues only organization-validated, high assurance SSL certificates.

		</p>,<p>""The researchers have noted that certificates for <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">Extended Validation (EV) SSL</a> websites cannot be faked in this way - because the EV standard requires SHA1 or better signatures, and indeed there are no MD5-signed EV certificates found by our survey.

Designed specifically for Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Office Communications Server 2007, but compatible with any platform, DigiCert’s UC Certificates cost as little as $262 per year for four server names. Requesting a UC certificate is made easier by DigiCert’s exclusive <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/easy-csr/exchange2007.htm"">CSR Command Generator for Exchange</a>, a free web-based application that eliminates the need to learn Exchange's New-ExchangeCertificate command and its confusing syntax.</p>,<p>“The Unified Communications SAN Certificate allows you to run all services on one IP address, significantly reducing the complexity of server configuration,” DigiCert CTO Paul Tiemann said. “It’s simple to add and remove SANs with our online certificate management tools and much easier to maintain than putting multiple IP addresses on your server and assigning a different certificate to each one. It’s also much cheaper – you pay only for the names you use, whether it's four or 25, with no ‘gotcha’ or hidden fees.”</p>,<p><strong>Wildcard Plus</strong></p>,<p>Designed for system administrators managing multiple subdomains or multiple servers, a DigiCert WildCard Plus certificate eliminates maintenance headaches and saves valuable time and cost typically associated with managing multiple certificates with varying expiration dates. WildCard Plus provides security for an entire domain (*.example.com), including www.example.com, mail.example.com and any other first-level subdomain; it even includes the base domain -- example.com – something traditional wildcard products do not offer.</p>,<p>DigiCert’s WildCard Plus also enhances mobile device compatibility by using the SAN field to overcome syntax errors related to the requisite asterisk (*) character in most wildcard certificates. While some mobile clients, including Windows Mobile 5, do not support the asterisk (*) for wildcard name matching, they do support SANs. DigiCert’s WildCard Plus resolves the syntax error by allow the addition of up to 10 specific subdomains. </p>,<p>“By adding the wildcard and the mail server name, for example, to the same certificate, mobile devices can now accept the specific host name,” Bretschneider said. “And because this is done with our Unlimited Server License, you can issue multiple certificates for as many subdomains as you need. Those ten additional subdomains are per certificate, so the Unlimited Server License essentially makes this unlimited, too. In the past, the only option was to add separate SSL Certificates. We’ve had many large clients save thousands of dollars with a WildCard Plus certificate, versus managing multiple certificates individually.” </p>,<p><strong>Easy CSR Command Generators</strong></p>,<p>DigiCert's Easy CSR Command Generators are free web-based tools designed to simplify the certificate signing request process for <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/easy-csr/openssl.htm"">generating CSRs in OpenSSL</a> and MS Exchange and eliminate the need to memorize cumbersome technical syntax. These tools enable certificate managers to compile the command using pre-defined fields and then generate the command code to embed into their server.</p>,<p>“The CSR Command Generators are truly unique tools in the industry,” said Jeff Snider, DigiCert's Director of Web Development. “Managing SSL certificates can be a complicated technical process, and we’re committed to making it as simple as possible and to providing the most value to our customers. These free tools are designed specifically to do just that.”</p>,<p>DigiCert offers a 30-day trial period for all SSL certificate products and provides a full 100% money-back guarantee. All products are backed by DigiCert’s industry-leading personalized support service, including step-by-step certificate setup and installation and ongoing support.

		The new ""Plus"" feature means different things for different certificates:</p>,<p>For Single-Name and EV Certificates - All DigiCert Single-Name and EV certificates are now designed to authenticate to the domain name with 
		and without the leading ""www.""  Previously, certificates were only issued to work with the ""www."" or without it, but not both ways. 
		With the new ""Plus"" feature, your Single-Name or EV certificate will work seamlessly, regardless of whether or not your visitors include ""www."" in the URL.</p>,<p>For Wildcard Certificates - The plus feature includes the base domain (""example.com"" in a certificate issued to ""*.example.com""), 
		overcoming a flaw in traditional wildcard certificates.  WildCard Plus also allows for compatibility for Windows Mobile 5, which does not otherwise 
		accept the ""*"" character that is basic to the syntax of Wildcard Certificates.  Server administrators have the ability to include specific subdomains 
		in their Wildcard certificates, which provides a method of name authentication that is compatible with Windows Mobile 5.</p>,<p>March 7, 2007 -- In a combined effort with Microsoft, DigiCert is excited to introduce the new DigiCert Unified Communications (UC) Certificate.  UC certificates are sometimes called SAN Certificates, because they use Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to secure up to 25 different fully qualified domain names.  They are designed to work with the new Microsoft Unified Communications server.  In addition, UC certificates are an excellent solution for server administrators who wish to secure many different domain names with the same certificate.  Because all DigiCert UC certificates are issued with an unlimited server license, server administrators have the freedom to install their certificates to as many different server as they wish at no extra cost.</p>,<p>

Organizations can now choose a package of 3, 10, or 25 EV SSL certificates to secure an entire domain name as they would with a traditional wildcard certificate.
		</p>,<p>
			<a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">DigiCert’s EV SSL certificates</a> confirm that websites have passed rigorous identity verification procedures through special indicators easily visible on the browser address bar. Using EV certificates gives visitors visual confirmation of the site’s legitimacy, helps to preserve brand reputation, and helps to protect site owners from phishing and online fraud. With this instant visual assurance, users have increased trust in the site owner and more confidence when submitting their data, which often leads to higher site conversions.

			While standard EV SSL certificates only secure a single name, DigiCert’s new <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.htm"">Wildcard</a> package offers the flexibility of a wildcard combined with the high-assurance security of EV SSL. Customers can choose a package of 3, 10, or 25 EV SSL certificates with a 1- or 2-year lifetime. All of the certificates in the package will have the same expiration date and can be used all at once or as needed over the term lifetime.
		</p>,<p>			
			The certificates in the EV Wildcard package are issued to the same base domain. With this new product, server administrators can deploy multiple EV SSL certificates across their domain similar to a traditional wildcard certificate. This makes it possible to secure an entire domain at the EV level at a much lower cost than any other option available today.

			“DigiCert’s new EV Wildcard packages are a simple and very affordable option for securing a whole domain with EV SSL,” says Travis Tidball, Vice President of Marketing. “EV is the new standard for encryption and authentication and our EV Wildcard alternative makes it easier to extend the proven benefits of EV to your entire IT infrastructure.”

			DigiCert certificates can be used with the SafeMashups MashSSL Web ToolKit to protect emerging Web 2.0 protocols that require applications to build a trusted pipe to each other while

		</p>,<p>
			""The recent session fixation vulnerability discovered in OAuth is a perfect example of the sort of vulnerabilities that arise when two web services have to communicate via a potentially 
			untrusted user"", said Ravi Ganesan, Founder and CEO, SafeMashups Inc. ""We are pleased to partner with a market leader like DigiCert to spur on the adoption of the emerging MashSSL standard,

		</p>,<p>			
			Because DigiCert Root Certificates will be supported within the SafeMashups Community Service (SCS) and the MashSSL Web ToolKit, DigiCert will be able to offer certificates to MashSSL

			communicating through a user's browser.  
		</p>,<p>			
			""The lack of a standard and secure approach to building a trusted pipe between your web service and that of your business partners through a potentially untrusted user is a common problem 
			that the innovative MashSSL technology protects against,"" explained Christopher Skarda, DigiCert's Vice President of Operations.  ""What is most interesting about MashSSL is that it requires
			no changes in the underlying protocol, and there is no end user impact. For instance, web services using OAuth can establish a MashSSL session and then simply use their existing OAuth 
			implementation without any changes to that protocol, or any changes to the browser.""
		</p>,<p>			
			DigiCert and SafeMashups have both reiterated their commitment to working through the standards process with other partners to make the MashSSL specification an open standard.

			LINDON, UT (September 1, 2010) - DigiCert, Inc., a leading provider of Authentication &amp; Encryption services, 
			today announced new features now available in 
			<a href=""https://www.digicert.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.htm"">Wildcard Plus SSL certificates</a>.
		</p>,<p>
			<a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> encrypt the transfer of sensitive information online. From online shopping to secure email messages or even private health records, 
			SSL certificates have a wide variety of applications in every industry.
		</p>,<p>			
			DigiCert Wildcard Plus certificates can secure any subdomain using subject alternative names (SANs). A traditional wildcard certificate for 
			*.example.com will only secure a first-level subdomain of example.com such as mail.example.com. DigiCert's Wildcard Plus certificate uses SANs 
			to secure any subdomain of example.com, including multi-level subdomains such as mail.internal.example.com. With this new feature, all subdomains 
			can be secured with a single Wildcard Plus certificate from DigiCert. The base domain itself, example.com, is automatically included as a SAN in 
			every Wildcard Plus certificate as well, which increases compatibility and protects example.com with or without the ""www.""
		</p>,<p>	
			With the use of SANs, Wildcard Plus certificates also resolve the issue that some mobile devices have with the asterisk (*) syntax. 
			Since mobile devices support SANs, Wildcard Plus certificates enable them to accept the specific host name without the need to purchase a separate SSL certificate.
		</p>,<p>			
			Additionally, with DigiCert's Unlimited Server License, Wildcard Plus certificates give more freedom to use certificates anywhere without extra license fees. 
			The certificate can be put on any server and any platform using the Duplicates feature through the DigiCert account interface and customers are able to issue
			as many certificates as needed for as many subdomains as needed.
		</p>,<p>			
			DigiCert Wildcard Plus SSL certificates are available with various licensing options. DigiCert strives to provide the best value and support possible.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""Flaws in TLSv1/SSLv3 have brought about potential vulnerabilities that can be patched easily on your server."">",<h1>Briefing on TLS Renego</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2011-06-03-ssl-renego.htm,<title>Fixing TLS Renegotiation On Your Server | DigiCert.com</title>,"<p>			
			<strong>Introduction</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			A flaw in the design of the TLS v. 1/SSL v. 3 (TLS/SSL) handshake process was discovered in 2009, and RFC 5746 (Feb. 2010) was released to update the
			protocol specification.   Since then, most system manufacturers have released patches to fix this flaw.   <span>Still, as of June 2011 approximately half of 
			the systems using TLS/SSL on the Internet have not implemented the patches needed to close this security hole.</span>  This vulnerability affects the secure 
			transport of HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, and other protocols that rely on TLS/SSL.   Industry representatives and security researchers who have looked into the
			problem note that sites with the TLS patch may still be vulnerable to this attack, known as the TLS renegotiation  Man-In-The-Middle attack (TLS Renego MITM).
			DigiCert is taking a proactive approach to this problem by contacting its customers to advise them of this potential vulnerability in their systems.
			<span>At some point in the future, connectivity problems may occur because of server non-compliance with RFC 5746.</span>
		</p>,<p>
			In other words, when RFC 5746 is fully deployed browser clients will refuse to connect to unpatched servers. 
		</p>,<p>
			<strong>Background</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			TLS/SSL allows both servers and clients to initiate a refresh or complete renegotiation of the encryption parameters used for TLS/SSL connections. 
			This ability gives the communicating parties an abbreviated process to resume a previously existing TLS/SSL session, often with a more secure set of 
			cryptographic parameters.  However, the design of the initial handshake and the renegotiation process had a gap that could allow a third party to send a 
			“client hello” and splice content into a client’s TLS/SSL session and then intercept TLS/SSL communications between the server and the client.   
		</p>,<p>
			Just to provide you with a brief overview, the typical TLS/SSL handshake process involves the following: 
		</p>,<p>
				<i><b>client hello</b> (highest TLS/SSL version supported, random number, suggested ciphers, suggested compression methods and, if the client is 
				attempting renegotiation, previous session ID)<br>		
				<b>server hello</b> (TLS/SSL version, random number, cipher suite and compression chosen and, if server is attempting renegotiation, previous session ID)<br>
				<b>server sends TLS/SSL certificate</b><br>
				<b>server hello done</b>
			</i></p>,<p>			
				<b>client key exchange</b> (preMasterSecret exchange and MasterSecret calculation)<br>
				<b>client change cipher spec</b><br>
				<b>client finished</b> (hash and MAC of previous handshake messages)
			</p>,<p>
				<b>server change cipher spec</b><br>
				<b>server finished</b>
			</p>,<p>			
				<b>GET /secure HTTP/1.1\r\n...</b>
			</p>,<p>	
				(For more information, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Resumed_TLS_handshake"">Wikipedia's article on TLS handshakes</a>).
			</p>,<p>	
			Using the TLS Renego MITM vulnerability, an attacker can either form a TLS connection to the server first, before the client 
			(for example, on a compromised machine in response to the client’s attempt at connection) or can use session renegotiation to effectuate the attack. 
			Even mutual certificate-based client authentication connections are vulnerable to the TLS Renego MITM attack.  More details on how various attack scenarios
			play out are provided in <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5746"">RFC 5746</a> and related discussions provided 
			<a href=""http://www.phonefactor.com/sslgapdocs/Renegotiating_TLS.pdf"">here</a>
			and <a href=""http://my.opera.com/securitygroup/blog/2010/01/23/alpha-testing-tls-renego-fix"">here</a>.  
		</p>,<p>
			<strong>Solution</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			The TLS/SSL specification in RFC 5746 applies to both full handshakes and session resumption handshakes.  
			Because pre-existing TLS/SSL specifications required systems to ignore a ClientHello extension if they did not understand it, 
			RFC 5746 specifies that the ClientHello either contain an empty  “renegotiation_info"" extension  or a Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) 
			as a pseudo cipher suite with the same semantics as an empty ""renegotiation_info"" extension.   When a client receives the ServerHello, 
			it must check to see if the server supports the ""renegotiation_info"" extension.   Assuming that secure renegotiation is supported per RFC 5746, 
			then for TLS renegotiation, the client can send the ""renegotiation_info"" extension.  If the server does not respond in accordance with RFC 5746, 
			the client MUST abort the renegotiation handshake.  Similarly, if a client does not respond in accordance with RFC 5746, then the server MUST abort 
			the renegotiation handshake.
		</p>,<p>
			For backward compatibility, a compliant client will be configurable for either allowing insecure renegotiation or aborting an attempt to renegotiate.  
			However, because some TLS servers do not support renegotiation at all there will be a transition period where problems will be encountered.
			From a server side, if the server does not receive the ""renegotiation_info"" extension or the SCSV, then RFC 5746 specifies that the 
			“secure_renegotiation” flag be set to FALSE.   Thereafter, if a ClientHello for renegotiation contains an empty  “renegotiation_info"" extension 
			or the SCSV, then the server MUST abort the handshake.
		</p>,<p>
			<strong>Product Information</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			<strong>Further Steps to Take for Secure TLS/SSL Communication</strong>
		</p>,<p>
			Finally, in addition to the fixes described above for the TLS Renego MITM attack, DigiCert recommends that server administrators disable SSL version 2 
			and disallow the use of weak cipher suites.  SSL version 2 provides no protection for the session negotiation handshake at the beginning of, nor at the
			end of the connection.  This means that a MITM attack can happen at any point during the communication (e.g. the MITM simply creates a false termination 
			message, splices into the SSL session, and deceives the parties into thinking their communication is still secure).   Allowing weak ciphers also 
			creates a problem.  A weak cipher is one with less than 128 bits of encryption (i.e. a string of 1 and 0s shorter than 128).   For example, the international 
			versions of IE 3 and Netscape used to provide only 40 bits of encryption.  Today, the minimum standard of 128 bits offers 88 additional bits of key length, 
			which means that there are 2^88 more possible combinations one would have to try in order to crack strong encryption.  Because support for SSL 2.0 and weak
			40-bit and 56-bit ciphers has been removed completely from several current browsers, such server configurations should no longer be necessary.

			Compatible with Microsoft, new certificates broaden company’s recognized “best in class” SSL certificates to kernel-mode software programmers and engineers.
		</p>,<p>
			Lindon, Utah - February 28, 2012 - Today, DigiCert, Inc., an online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and websites in the world, announced that its code signing high-assurance digital certificates are now compatible with Microsoft kernel-mode software. With this extension to its growing product suite, DigiCert becomes one of just a handful of global Certificate Authorities (CA) to offer this service. Microsoft requires developers to digitally sign kernel-mode software for its Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 operating systems prior to installation.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert continues to broaden its product offerings in response to consumer demand for code signing certificates that are compatible with various operating systems,” said DigiCert Chief Operations Officer Nicholas Hales. “We recognize that today’s network engineers and software developers face increasing responsibilities and security concerns; as with all of our products and services, DigiCert’s kernel-mode certificates are available at competitive rates backed by value-added features and unmatched customer support to increase the efficiency and productivity of the IT department.”
		</p>,<p>
			Kernel-mode certificates allow users to digitally sign software and device drivers, which in turn proves identity to users and protects software from being modified after creation. Failing to digitally sign kernel-mode software with a certificate from a reliable third-party leads to a warning in Windows that prevents users from installing any code. DigiCert kernel-mode code signing certificates support Silverlight 4 and work with ActiveX controls, plug-ins and other executables, and they include an optional timestamp to show when the code was signed.
		</p>,<p>
			The world’s third-largest issuer of high-assurance digital certificates, DigiCert continues to expand market share through a company focus on enhanced customer value—recently recognized with Frost &amp; Sullivan’s “Best in Class” award—and unmatched support. With the company’s kernel-mode signing, customers get the same quick installation and customer support they have come to expect from a knowledgeable team that is available 24/7 via phone or chat.

		</p>,<p>
			Lindon, Utah - February 23, 2012 - Data breaches at healthcare organizations surged 32 percent according to a Dec. 2011 study released by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored by ID Experts, and tools that enhance trust in web platforms are at a premium. Scott Rea, VP of Education/Government Relations and Sr. PKI Architect at <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, an online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and websites in the world, will discuss enterprise security solutions Feb. 23 at the HIMSS 2012 Conference in Las Vegas. Rea’s remarks come on the heels of reports from the same Ponemon study that data breaches cost U.S. healthcare organizations $6 billion a year. Managed Public Key Infrastructure (MPKI) systems enable trust and give control to network administrators who are especially concerned with devices brought into the workplace by employees and third-parties.
		</p>,<p>
			“Notable organizations, particularly in medium- to large-sized enterprises, are increasingly looking to exercise greater control over the inbound and outbound messages on their servers as well as management of mobile devices connected to the network,” said Rea. “With MPKI, IT administrators can protect multiple servers and domains, authenticating online exchanges through one certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority like DigiCert.”
		</p>,<p>
			A seasoned implementer of Managed PKI systems, Rea is an active member of several PKI-related forums including the Federal PKI Policy Authority Certificate Policy Working Group, the Research and Education Bridge Certification Authority, the Four Bridges Forum, and the International Grid Trust Federation. In his role at DigiCert, he works with many clients, particularly in the higher education, medical and government arenas, to set up customized MPKI solutions.

			recognizes <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/"">DigiCert, Inc.</a> with the 2011 North American Frost &amp; Sullivan Award for Customer Value
			Enhancement. With best-in-class product solutions, competitive pricing and award-winning customer support, DigiCert provides excellent customer value

			the market, with the ability to secure any subdomain to which the certificate was issued, saving network administrators time and money.
		</p>,<p>
			""DigiCert's commitment to the highest quality and cost-effective online security services reaffirms the company's efforts to provide best-in-class
			products for its respective target markets,"" said Frost &amp; Sullivan Research Analyst Richard Martinez. ""Its Wildcard, Unified Communications and

		</p>,<p>
			<b><i>DigiCert SSL Certificates Offer Unique Value in Its Industry</i></b>
			<i></i>
		</p>,<p>
	DigiCert has established new standards in the SSL market to include its Wildcard, <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/multi-domain-ssl.htm"">Unified Communications (UC)</a> certificates and		<a href=""https://www.digicert.com/mpki/"">Managed Public Key Infrastructure (MPKI)</a> services. By doing so, DigiCert has developed a
			flexible product suite tailored to different customer needs.
		</p>,<p>
			""DigiCert has found a growing niche within the SSL market by offering value-added features that simplify IT network management while maintaining
			competitive prices,"" said Martinez. ""In an era when companies are closely managing costs and requiring more productivity out of workers, DigiCert's
			products offer market advantages.""
		</p>,<p>
			<i>Wildcard</i>
		</p>,<p>
			While DigiCert's competitors offer Wildcard certificates that only cover the first-level, or a limited number of subdomains, DigiCert has developed a
			cutting-edge Wildcard certificate that encrypts and secures any subdomain, using subject alternative names (SANs). The addition of SANs to Wildcard
			certificates make them compatible with mobile devices.
		</p>,<p>
			For network administrators who run multiple subdomains or multiple servers, most SSL certificate authorities on the market require them to purchase
			multiple certificates for their networks. DigiCert's Wildcard certificate benefits administrators in that just one certificate secures multiple web
			properties.
		</p>,<p>
			<i>Unified Communications</i>
		</p>,<p>
			Exceeding industry standards, DigiCert offers Unified communications (UC) certificates which let an administrator secure up to 25 server names with one
			certificate. The UC certificates allow customers to add, remove or edit SANs from within their account through the certificate's lifetime. In addition,
			UC and Wildcard customers can issue free duplicate certificates assigned to unique private keys. DigiCert offers this security feature so organizations
			do not have to export and install the same certificate on multiple systems.
		</p>,<p>
			<i>Managed Public Key Infrastructure</i>
		</p>,<p>
			For larger organizations using multiple servers, DigiCert offers Managed Public Key Infrastructure (MPKI) services. This web-based interface allows
			account administrators to take control of SSL certificate management-including issuing new certificates and reissuing, replacing and revoking existing
			certificates on-demand-eliminating the short waiting period associated with retail requests.
		</p>,<p>
			The <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificate</a> market has three different segments within each certificate type. With
			domain validation, organization validation and an extended validation certificate, customers have different requirements from their certificates,
			serving different organization tier levels. While many certificate authorities offer all three types of certificates, some forgo this option to
			establish their position and brand in the markets they serve.
		</p>,<p>
			As a leading company in the mid- to top-tier of the SSL certificate market, DigiCert centers its products on organization validation and extended
			validation certificates, which offer an extra layer of validation and a higher level of assurance than domain validation certificates.
		</p>,<p>
			""While price sensitivity at these levels is not as high as with domain validation certificate customers, DigiCert aims to provide a commendable,
			high-value certificate at competitive prices,"" said Martinez. ""DigiCert's commitment to the highest quality and cost-effective security testifies to
			the company's efforts to provide best-in-class products for its respective target markets.""
		</p>,<p>
			Each year, Frost &amp; Sullivan presents this award to the company that demonstrates excellence in implementing strategies that proactively create
			value for customers with a focus on improving the return on the investment. This award recognizes the company's focus on enhancing the value that its
			customers receive, beyond simply good customer service, leading to improved customer retention and ultimately, customer base expansion.
		</p>,<p>
			Frost &amp; Sullivan Best Practices awards recognize companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement
			and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service and strategic product development. Industry analysts
			compare market participants and measure performance through in-depth interviews, analysis and extensive secondary research to identify best practices
			in the industry.

			LINDON, UT (April 26, 2012) — <a href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, an online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and websites in the world, today launched the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/discovery-tool.htm"">DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool</a>. Available to anyone free of charge, the web-based application scans an organization’s network to locate SSL certificates deployed across several departments and business units, regardless of which Certificate Authority (CA) issued the certificate. The DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool is designed to help busy IT professionals save time and money, and avoid costly mistakes from manual inventory. A shutdown caused by an unforeseen certificate expiration on a critical server could significantly disrupt business and even lead to compliance issues.
		</p>,<p>
			Many medium to large enterprises may have hundreds, if not thousands, of certificates deployed at any given time. Businesses that choose to employ enterprise solutions such as DigiCert’s <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/mpki/"">Enterprise Managed PKI</a> products, may simplify SSL certificate management through centralization. However, in the case of organizations without a centralized approach – or even with some companies that employ enterprise management – the deployment of just one outlier certificate from another certificate provider can go unnoticed and potentially wreak havoc.
		</p>,<p>
			“Over time, with organizational growth and increasing use of cloud IT and mobile integration, some SSL certificates can fall through the cracks,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “The DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool simplifies the task of controlling large deployments of SSL certificates from multiple authorities across diverse platforms, giving administrators the tools they need at their fingertips to avoid SSL downtime and maximize certificate value.”
		</p>,<p>
			The DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool streamlines certificate management and eases renewal by allowing administrators to sign up for e-mail alerts seven and 30 days prior to expiration, regardless of which CA issued the certificate. For DigiCert customers, they may take advantage of integration with the company’s client account tools for one-stop certificate renewals. Free and simple to install, anyone can get the Discovery Tool by entering their information at digicert.com. After that, a registrant receives an e-mail with a link to download the application and an activation code to get it running.
		</p>,<p>
			“Certificate management and tracking, especially for those companies using more than one CA for their security needs, can be difficult,” said Richard Martinez, research analyst for Frost &amp; Sullivan. “DigiCert’s SSL Discovery Tool is yet another value-added service and a continuation of a customer-friendly approach that has earned the company ‘best in class’ status for offering customer value enhancement.”
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert is the recognized leader in flexible, <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">high-assurance SSL</a> certificates and award-winning customer support. The DigiCert SSL Discovery Tool is the latest in a series of SSL deployment web applications and trainings provided by the company for use by anyone, free of charge.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""GlobalSign, DigiCert, Comodo and Nginx, Inc. improve Online Trust through Enhanced Certificate Revocation Checking, sign a Sponsorship Agreement"">",<h1>DigiCert Signs Sponsorship Agreement with NGINX</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2012-06-20-nginx-sponsorship-agreement.htm,<title>NGINX Sponsorship Agreement</title>,"<p>
			SAN FRANCISCO, CA (June 20, 2012) — Today GlobalSign, DigiCert, Comodo and NGINX announced a joint effort and a sponsored development contract, to enhance the NGINX open source Web server to support OCSP-stapling. This collaboration further advances the SSL ecosystem by improving the privacy, reliability and revocation checking for all websites using the NGINX web server — currently run by more than 25 percent of the top 1,000 websites, and by 70 million websites on the Internet overall.
		</p>,<p>
			“The team at NGINX is delighted that GlobalSign, DigiCert and Comodo support the OCSP stapling enhancement to the NGINX webserver,” said Igor Sysoev CTO and principal architect at NGINX, “We have been continuously working on enhancements to NGINX that increase performance, reliability and security.  With improved SSL functionality, we expect the vast majority of our customers to share our enthusiasm for increased safety on the Internet.”
		</p>,<p>
			The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is used to present the revocation status, or current validity, of an SSL certificate, and provides an alternative to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) method. OCSP offers efficiencies when compared to the CRL method, which requires the client, such as a browser, to download potentially large databases of revocation information reflecting the status as of its last publication date In contrast, OCSP can provide more up-to-date status information by allowing the browser to query the revocation status at the very point of encountering the certificate, without relying on cached information.
		</p>,<p>
			OCSP-stapling enhances the basic OCSP method by allowing the presenter of a certificate, such as the website hosting the SSL certificate, to deliver the OCSP response to the browser instead of it being delivered by the issuing CA. By keeping the certificate response within the web host and not with the CA, OCSP-stapling ensures the browser receives the same response performance for the certificate status information as it does for the website content. This helps to maintain a high-quality user experience and avoids delays otherwise caused by request volume or network congestion that can slow CA response under the standard OCSP method. Compared with basic OCSP, privacy concerns are also addressed, as the CA is no longer receiving revocation requests directly from the browser. 
		</p>,<p>
			In a collective statement by GlobalSign, DigiCert and Comodo, GlobalSign Chief Technology Officer Ryan Hurst stated, “By addressing the issues holding back common usage of OCSP, NGINX is contributing toward a unified goal of widespread OCSP adoption across all webservers on the Internet.  This project is another major initiative where certification authorities are working closely to improve the ecosystem for everyone relying on SSL for a safer, private and more secure Internet experience.” 
		</p>,<p>
			NGINX is the second most popular open source webserver and, according to the W3Techs server survey, is currently used by more than 25 percent of the top 1,000 most visited websites.  The new version with full OCSP-stapling support will be available in late August 2012. IIS on Microsoft Server 2008 and Apache 2.3.6 already support OCSP-stapling; thus, the enhancements to NGINX mean that nearly all webservers can now deploy this critical technology.
		</p>,<p>
			For current release information on the new version of NGINX, please visit <a href=""http://www.nginx.com/"">www.nginx.com</a>.
		</p>,<p>
			<b>About NGINX</b>
		</p>,<p>
			Run by the busiest websites on the Internet, NGINX enables businesses worldwide to match rapidly increasing demand for faster web experience without incurring unnecessary costs in capital investments or time.  In almost 10 years of its history, NGINX became key software component of most famous web architectures.  Today NGINX serves over 25 percent of the top 1,000 websites, and 70 million of websites overall.  Successful online services, transforming and shaping the future of Internet—such as Netflix, Pinterest, CloudFlare, Airbnb, WordPress, GitHub, SoundCloud, Zynga, Eventbrite, Zappos, Media Temple, Heroku, RightScale, Engine Yard, use NGINX as part of their infrastructures.

			BOSTON, MA (July 17, 2012) — Today, as the nation’s leading web hosting providers gather in Boston for the HostingCon 2012 conference, DigiCert is inviting resellers to enable customer business success by providing high-assurance <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a>, issued within hours. Throughout the show, company staff will be available at Booth #229 to discuss how DigiCert can help web hosts quickly and easily deploy high-assurance SSL certificates, such as Extended Validation (EV) certificates, that increase customer trust and conversion.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert is pleased to offer partnering opportunities for web hosts and other resellers seeking to provide high-assurance SSL certificates to their customers,” said DigiCert VP of Sales Aaron Watson. “We’re excited to combine one of the SSL industry’s largest libraries of free tools, award-winning customer support, fast issuance times and competitive pricing to help web hosts deliver premium value to their customers.”
		</p>,<p>
			Recent studies demonstrate the trends toward increasing adoption of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/extended-validation-ev-ssl.htm"">EV SSL</a> certificates. Last month, the Online Trust Alliance released its 2012 Online Trust Honor Roll and Report, which noted a 48 percent increase in EV certificate deployment over 2011 among those surveyed. As consumers more closely scrutinize where they will conduct online business and e-commerce, EV certificates offer the heightened security measures and browser bar trust indicators that can lead to higher conversions for online merchants. With increasing conversions and revenues, web hosts choosing to employ EV certificates can yield greater customer loyalty, retention and business while also solidifying their brand as a security-minded firm.
		</p>,<p>
			As a leading Certificate Authority (CA) and the world’s third-largest issuer of high-assurance certificates, DigiCert brings to resellers an unmatched value proposition of best security practices, competitive pricing for <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">EV SSL certificates</a> and hassle-free customer support. The company also offers its <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/discovery-tool.htm"">SSL Discovery Tool</a> free of charge, which web hosts can utilize to help current and prospective customers identify and address their security needs. DigiCert’s focus on customer value and partnership led to its being named “Best in Class” for SSL Customer Value Enhancement in 2011 by Frost &amp; Sullivan.
		</p>,<p>
			“Now is an opportune time for resellers to pass along the DigiCert value to their customers, while enjoying enhanced partner revenue and a simplified certificate deployment process,” said Watson.

			LINDON, UT (August 14, 2012) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and web sites in the world, today announced a major breakthrough in application code security with the availability of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm"">Extended Validation Code Signing Certificates</a>.
		</p>,<p>
			EV Code Signing Certificates from DigiCert must adhere to strict validation procedures from the CA/Browser Forum and Microsoft specifications. In addition to passing through DigiCert’s thorough and rigorous review, EV Code Signing customers employ hardware to receive and install their certificate.
		</p>,<p>
			Additionally, <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm"">EV Code Signing Certificates</a> from DigiCert can enable code developers for Windows 8, Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 to immediately establish initial reputation with SmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that file or publisher. SmartScreen simplifies trust decisions by only providing warnings for applications without established reputation. EV Code Signing Certificates also help ensure that as developers renew their certificates, the reputation established with the original certificate remains intact across renewals.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert’s  EV Code Signing Certificates can be trusted by Microsoft SmartScreen reputation services starting today, meaning that application developers can establish reputation in Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 9 and 10 immediately,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “Additionally, developers can rely upon DigiCert as a code-signing partner committed to high assurance and customer support to take care of any needs they might have throughout the lifecycle of their certificate.”
		</p>,<p>
			Continued Hales, “The additional safeguards afforded developers who sign their code with EV <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/"">Code Signing</a> Certificates include two-factor authentication with a physical token, which provides an improved barrier against malware and other attacks.”
		</p>,<p>
			“We are pleased to support the certificate authority industry’s introduction of Extended Validation Code Signing Certificates as a step forward to help ensure developer identity, code signing security and user safety,” said Microsoft General Manager – Safety Services, John Scarrow. “These new certificates provide deep verification of developer identity and, in addition, require a hardware element to further secure the code signing process. Given these advances, EV signed applications can immediately establish reputation with Microsoft’s SmartScreen Application Reputation services in Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10 and Windows 8.”
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert EV Code Signing customers gain access to an array of free training and tools as well as the company’s award-winning customer support team. EV Code Signing certificates from DigiCert are available at <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm"">https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm</a> with various licensing options up to three years.

			LINDON, UT (August 28, 2012) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading online security provider for many of the most recognized brands and web sites in the world, is now issuing high-assurance <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> even faster – typically within less than an hour. While fast issuance and strong authentication have always been core tenets of DigiCert’s service philosophy, its support team has recently completed a streamlining initiative that has improved DigiCert’s certificate issuance times by 50 percent in the last 12 months.
		</p>,<p>
			This is welcome news for network and security engineers looking to save time while providing the highest level of authenticity to their users from a webtrust-audited, security-minded Certificate Authority like DigiCert. The additional hours, days or even weeks gained in not waiting for their certificate from another SSL provider frees up IT professionals to address the many other tasks on their ever-growing to-do lists.
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert employs a tenured, knowledgeable staff to help guide customers through the process of organization and extended validation to avoid unnecessary delays and save customers valuable time. Prioritizing security, DigiCert retains the steps required to ensure a thoroughly validated and authenticated certificate.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert serves as our primary <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/welcome/ssl-plus.htm"">SSL</a> provider, because of their amazing customer support and prompt turnaround,” said Jason Webber, Director of Information Technology at HubSpot, Inc. “With a rapidly growing organization, we see great value in DigiCert’s knowledgeable, friendly support staff and tools to help us securely and quickly deploy new certificates, with the confidence that the company will be there throughout all stages of the certificate lifecycle.”
		</p>,<p>
			The issuance of high-assurance certificates may take days or even weeks with some providers, motivating organizations to settle for lower-assurance options such as domain-validated certificates. DigiCert’s capabilities mean that organizations no longer have to choose between high-assurance and speed of issuance. At a time when consumers are demanding greater trust of the websites where they choose to do business – online retailers are responding in 2012 with a 48 percent increase in <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">EV SSL</a> deployment over 2011, according to a June Online Trust Association report – DigiCert makes high-assurance certificates a clear choice, typically fulfilling orders within less than an hour, not days.
		</p>,<p>
			Customers who bring the appropriate identification materials with them when they order their certificate can expect a fast and secure issuance process. DigiCert is webtrust-audited and actively promotes the highest standards within the industry groups to which it belongs. Additionally, DigiCert stands behind its commitment to quality with a $1 million warranty and a 30-day money back guarantee for any dissatisfied customers. DigiCert’s knowledgeable support staff guides customers during each step of the order process, beginning at installation and throughout the lifecycle of the certificate. Currently, DigiCert is the only five-star rated Certificate Authority on the independent rating site <a href=""http://www.sslshopper.com"">sslshopper.com</a>.

			(February 14, 2013) — Each day, DigiCert works hard to provide the best value to you, our customers. We compete hard to be your preferred Certificate Authority (CA), and we appreciate your business.
		</p>,<p>
			On certain matters, however, we choose to put aside competition and collaborate with other CAs to promote activities and practices that will advance internet security. That’s why we are announcing today the formation of the CA Security Council (CASC), an industry leadership initiative designed to promote best practices in the issuance, deployment, and use of SSL.
		</p>,<p>
			For nearly two decades, SSL has formed the backbone of internet security.  Today, SSL continues to be the best method of protecting sensitive information that is exchanged online. Each day, members of the CASC secure billions of online connections. Because of the high value of these transactions, we have seen an increase in the number and sophistication of attacks by cybercriminal organizations, hacktivists, and even state-sponsored espionage, making a group dedicated to promoting practical enhancements and global standards a necessity.
		</p>,<p>
			Through the CASC, DigiCert can collaborate with other interested stakeholders in improving awareness of critical policies developed in other venues and their potential impact on the internet infrastructure. Members of the CASC are coming together to help encourage best practices, promote improved deployment of a continually trustworthy SSL ecosystem, and help educate end-users on how SSL works and how they can keep themselves safe.
		</p>,<p>
			Coinciding with the CASC launch, the group is announcing the first of a planned series of educational and advocacy efforts related to best practices in SSL deployment.  The group’s initial focus is on the importance of online certificate status checking and revocation. These first efforts will help people understand the benefits of online certificate status protocol (OCSP) stapling and how it can be widely implemented to help provide a more secure internet.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""MiHIN initiative to help improve healthcare quality and affordability for Michigan residents through fast, secure electronic exchange of health information"">","<h1>Michigan, DigiCert, Nitor Group Reach Agreeement
</h1>",https://www.digicert.com/news/2013-03-05-michigan-health-information-network-shared-services.htm,<title>Michigan Health Information Network Shared Services</title>,"<p style=""float:right;margin:5px 15px 10px 15px;""><img src=""/images/mihin-logo.jpg"" alt=""Michigan Health Information Network Shared Services""></p>,<p>
			EAST LANSING, MI (March 5, 2013) — Today the Michigan Health Information Network (MiHIN) Shared Services announced an agreement with leading high-assurance digital certificate provider DigiCert and health information services provider (HISP) Nitor Group to use DigiCert’s federally bridged certificates for secure interstate sharing of electronic health information. This project, one of the first of its kind in the U.S., supports MiHIN’s mission to improve healthcare outcomes for Michigan residents by providing trusted means by which patients, providers and insurers can securely exchange private medical records across state boundaries. The announcement also serves as a model of an effective public-private relationship to other states working to implement and carry out the Meaningful Use stages.
		</p>,<p>
			The new solution allows MiHIN to issue federally bridged digital certificates from DigiCert to efficiently and securely transfer encrypted electronic health records of Michigan residents between accredited healthcare providers and insurers with respect to Michigan residents wherever they may receive treatment. This capability significantly shortens the time required to receive critical electronic records at the point of care and improve patient outcomes while also lowering costs. DigiCert is the first publicly trusted Certificate Authority to issue certificates that meet the Direct protocols for health information exchange and are cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority. Given its prominent role in drafting the governance aspects of the Direct protocol that will be used in the DirectTrust community, DigiCert is lending its expertise and infrastructure in working with HISPs, insurers and state exchanges to support compliance across the country.
		</p>,<p>
			MiHIN Chief Security Officer Brian Seggie commented, “With DigiCert’s new federally bridged security certificates MiHIN is now able to go into full production with secure exchange of patient health information between Michigan and our five border states, our “snowbird” states in warmer climes, and other states that Michigan residents frequently visit where they sometimes receive treatment. In some sense, this is as exciting as building the interstate highway system, but for the timely and secure exchange of information between states that will improve patient outcomes and in some cases, potentially save lives.”
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert is pleased to be able to work with MiHIN and Nitor Group to advance this critical work on behalf of the state of Michigan and its residents and health providers,” said DigiCert VP of Government, Education Relations and Senior PKI Architect Scott Rea, who also serves on the board of DirectTrust. “As an organization, we’re committed to contributing our expertise within DirectTrust to help improve the quality and affordability of healthcare through the Direct initiative.”
		</p>,<p>
			MiHIN Senior Integration and Design Architect Jeff Shaw observed, “Using the Direct secure message technology and these new enhanced certifications allows MiHIN to transport health information while ensuring that the information remains securely encrypted between providers in Michigan and in other states. Using federally bridged certificates also allows exchange with federal agencies, such as the Center for Disease Control for public health issues and the Veterans Health Administration to ensure that those who served our country receive the best care possible. This secure means of sharing health information across state lines gives health professionals across the nation an easy-to-use platform that can also scale upwards to grow as health information sharing evolves.”

			The Direct Project was initiated in early 2010 under the direction of the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services and the ONC with the goal of benefitting patients and providers by improving the transport of health information, making it faster, more secure and less expensive. The Direct Project establishes scalable standards and documentation to support simple scenarios of pushing data from point-to-point in a trusted way that improves interoperability by providing rules-based methods of interstate and interagency sharing. It also improves healthcare outcomes by moving this type of information sharing away from traditional mail and fax methods.

			San Francisco, CA (February 14, 2013) — Leading global certificate authorities announced the creation of the Certificate Authority Security Council (CASC), an advocacy group, committed to the exploration and promotion of best practices that advance the security of websites and online transactions. Through public education, collaboration, and advocacy, the CASC strives to improve understanding of critical policies and their potential impact on the internet infrastructure. Members of the CASC include Comodo, DigiCert, Entrust, GlobalSign, Go Daddy, Symantec, and Trend Micro.

		</p>,<p>
			Amid increasing threats from sophisticated hacker networks, global cybercriminal organizations and state-sponsored espionage, the CASC is coming together to promote advanced security standards, encourage best practices, and ultimately improve the deployment of a continually trustworthy SSL ecosystem. In addition, the CASC supports the efforts of the CA/Browser Forum and other standards-setting bodies in their important work, and will continue to help develop reasonable and practical enhancements that improve trusted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and certificate authority (CA) operations.
		</p>,<p>
			Coinciding with its launch, the CASC is announcing the first of a planned series of educational and advocacy efforts related to best practices in SSL deployment with a focus on the importance of online certificate status checking and revocation. Specifically, the CASC will highlight the benefits of online certificate status protocol (OCSP) stapling for Web server administrators, software vendors, browser developers, and end-users through blog posts, conference presentations and other resources. For more information, visit
			<a href=""https://casecurity.org/initiatives/"" target=""_blank"">casecurity.org/initiatives</a>.
		</p>,<p>
			The backbone of Internet security for nearly two decades, the SSL protocol and certificates from publicly trusted CAs remain the most proven, reliable and scalable method to protect Internet transactions. The CASC is focused on promoting tightened global standards to mitigate high-profile security incidents, and improving research and collaboration that will continue to establish the security-robustness of the SSL ecosystem.

			“SSL remains today the most widely deployed and successful cryptography system in the world,” said Dean Coclin, Steering Committee, Certificate Authority Security Council. “As a unified group of the world’s leading SSL providers, we’re collaborating on matters of highest priority, while also recognizing the value of previous and recent work to continually evolve the standards, and create an industry that understands the issues involved and is committed to making the necessary enhancements.”
		</p>,<p>
			<b>Industry Influencer</b><br>
			“The CASC is a group of global trust anchors, who understand the necessity for continually evolving security that meets the needs of web sites and their users,” said Yngve Pettersen, Independent Researcher. “The creation of the CASC is a step in the right direction to making practical, scalable improvements to the current SSL/TLS ecosystem while promoting security standards and better education among users.”
		</p>,<p>
			<b>CA/Browser Forum</b><br>
			“The CASC members are working actively with browsers and other parties to further improve existing methods that effectively balance performance and security while providing a trusted experience for all internet users,” said Ben Wilson, Chair, CA/Browser Forum. “These collaborative efforts have led to important steps forward that help improve security practices, self-regulation, and globalize the adoption and implementation of stricter, more universal standards. We look forward to working with the CASC to set quality standards that raise the bar for everyone.”

			BOSTON, MA (December 17, 2012) — TA Associates, a leading global growth private equity firm, today announced it has completed a majority investment in DigiCert, Inc., a leading provider of enterprise security solutions.  Terms of the investment were not disclosed.
		</p>,<p>
			Founded in 2003, DigiCert provides online authentication and encryption services primarily through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates to companies, government agencies, financial institutions, and educational and medical institutions worldwide, including some of the most recognized brands and organizations in the world.  SSL protocol enables applications to transmit information securely.  Organizations must install SSL certificates, usually indicated by an “https://” designation or a padlock icon in the browser address bar, on their web servers in order to initiate secure sessions with web browsers.  DigiCert is the world’s third largest issuer of high-assurance certificates, serving more than 60,000 clients in 176 countries.  The company is headquartered in Lindon, Utah.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert offers a compelling value proposition to its customers,” said Jason P. Werlin, a Principal at TA Associates who will join the company’s Board of Directors.  “The company’s differentiators include excellent customer service, best in class security and user-friendly tools, all offered at an affordable price.  As a result, DigiCert has seen very strong growth over the past several years.  We look forward to working closely with the company’s talented management team to continue that growth.”
		</p>,<p>
			“We have known the professionals at TA Associates for many years and are pleased to welcome the firm as an investor in DigiCert,” said Nicholas Hales, CEO, DigiCert, Inc.  “DigiCert has grown through strategic product development, key partnerships, an unrelenting focus on customer success and attracting strong talent to strengthen DigiCert’s corporate infrastructure.  A partnership with a deeply experienced firm like TA fits squarely within that focus and we are confident this will prove to be a highly beneficial and productive relationship for DigiCert.”
		</p>,<p>
			“We chose to partner with TA Associates because of their demonstrated experience in adding value to profitable, growing businesses such as DigiCert,” said Ryan Woodley, DigiCert’s CFO and COO.  “Over the past several years, we have substantially grown revenues and increased market share primarily through earned trust and client referrals.  With TA’s added support and strategic guidance we will strive to accelerate that growth.”
		</p>,<p>
			“Growth in the SSL certificate market is the result of several trends, including the need for web pages handling sensitive information to have secure lines for data transfer, as well as new security challenges posed by cloud computing,” said A. Bruce Johnston, a Managing Director at TA Associates who will also join the company’s Board of Directors.  “In addition, the continued growth in e-commerce and the attendant need to establish secure vendor websites will foster ongoing demand for SSL certificates.  DigiCert is well positioned to capitalize on these trends.”

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""Automatically generate Certificate Signing Requests and install SSL certificates with a single click, eliminating cumbersome interfaces and command processes"">","<h1>DigiCert Introduces New SSL Certificate Utility
</h1>",https://www.digicert.com/news/2013-06-10-new-ssl-certificate-utility.htm,<title>New SSL Certificate Utility</title>,"<p>
			LINDON, UT (June 10, 2013) — Today, leading global authentication and encryption company, DigiCert, Inc., announced the availability of a revolutionary Certificate Utility for Windows that allows administrators to generate and install SSL certificates with just a single click. The DigiCert single click SSL installer automatically generates the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), downloads the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificate</a>, and installs the certificate on the server. Administrators no longer need to navigate cumbersome interfaces or memorize complicated commands.
		</p>,<p>
			After purchasing a certificate, pre-verified administrators can use the utility to automatically create a private key and CSR, send the CSR to DigiCert, issue the certificate, and install the certificate directly on their server.
		</p>,<p>
			Many security engineers and network administrators interface with SSL certificates only when deploying a new server or renewing an existing SSL certificate. For these professionals, the process required to create a CSR, undergo rigorous organizational validation, and install a certificate extracts too many cycles from their already busy schedule.
		</p>,<p>
			“The DigiCert Certificate Utility is unlike any other tool available on the market. DigiCert’s single click SSL installer allows security engineers to seamlessly create a CSR and install a digital certificate with a single click and without the use of plug-ins or vouchers,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “Organizations looking to deploy SSL more broadly will find that this tool eliminates their pain points. The tool aligns with our company’s vision to help our customers achieve optimum security and enhanced productivity.”
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert’s automated SSL installer eliminates inconsistent SSL deployment across the organization, which wastes time and resources, and possibly creates vulnerabilities. The DigiCert single click SSL installer helps to streamline SSL certificate installation and minimize mistakes by providing a simple, consistent SSL certificate installation solution that seamlessly integrates with all Microsoft server platforms. Master account administrators can delegate certificate installation with peace of mind knowing that the system is fully auditable and automatically creates logs of the process taken to create and install the certificate.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""DigiCert/DataMotion partnership enables direct secure messaging among government &amp; private sector healthcare providers using Common Dual-mode Direct Med CA"">",<h1>DigiCert and DataMotion Partnership Advances Healthcare Exchange</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2013-06-12-datamotion-partnership.htm,<title>DigiCert and DataMotion Partnership</title>,"<p>
			LINDON, UT and MORRISTOWN, N.J. (June 12, 2013) — DigiCert, the leading high-assurance <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">digital certificate</a> provider, and DataMotion, an innovative <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.datamotion.com/DirectProject/HealthcareDirectvendor.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">health information service provider (HISP)</a> with more than 14 years of experience in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.datamotion.com/DirectProject/HealthcareDirectHIE.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">secure data delivery services</a>, today announced a groundbreaking partnership to expand common dual-mode certification for commercial and federal use for the healthcare industry. The partnership promises to improve patient care by making it much simpler for federal and non-federal organizations to engage in the secure electronic exchange of healthcare information.
		</p>,<p>
			The DigiCert/DataMotion partnership is a major step forward in fulfilling the vision of DirectTrust, an independent non-profit trade association tasked with overcoming secure data transfer challenges related to the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/direct-project/"">Direct Project</a>. Overseen by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, the Direct Project is a federal healthcare initiative fostering a standard method to securely exchange electronic healthcare information. It is aimed at ensuring compliance with federal privacy requirements and improving patient outcomes.
		</p>,<p>
			The partnership makes DataMotion the first HISP to use DigiCert’s dual-mode Direct Med Certificate Authority (Direct Med CA) in the DirectTrust Transitional Trust Anchor Bundle. The Bundle is a collection of trust anchor certificates from HISPs that meet common policies and practices for transmitting healthcare data across geographies and technologies. It eliminates the need for HISPs to manually exchange trust anchors, avoiding complex legal hurdles and one-off contracts. Direct secure messaging leverages the Internet and is far more efficient and secure than fax-based communication. As a result, participating HISPs can quickly help healthcare organizations, providers and patients to communicate in a way that is Direct-compliant and with an expanding community of trusted partners.
		</p>,<p>
			“The DigiCert Direct Med CA leverages policy processing capabilities to make the Direct protocol much more efficient to implement. This breakthrough eases certification difficulties that have threatened to stall adoption of the Direct Project,” said DigiCert’s Vice President of Government/Education Relations and Senior PKI Architect, Scott Rea, also a member of the Board of Directors for DirectTrust. “We need a national security and trust framework with a foundation of standards-based accreditation, supported by technology to easily on-board healthcare providers. Because our Direct Med CA facilitates commercial and federal use for multiple trust assurance levels, more providers will now be able to quickly and safely exchange information more efficiently. By partnering with DataMotion - a leading HISP with a secure data delivery pedigree - we’re able to get this to market quickly and help build the DirectTrust community.”
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert has been at the forefront of Direct-related innovation and was first to issue Direct-compliant Federal Bridge Certification Authority certificates for Federal agencies to interoperate with non-federal organizations. Combined with digital certificates for commercial entities, the Direct Med CA can now serve all of healthcare with basic and medium assurance levels. By incorporating this capability into its HISP services, DataMotion is now able to offer a turnkey solution that will enable electronic health record (EHR) vendors and their customers to easily meet real-world healthcare communications needs.
		</p>,<p>
			“This takes a huge burden off of healthcare providers by greatly simplifying their use of Direct messaging,” said DataMotion Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Bob Janacek. “Through this partnership EHR vendors now have a comprehensive solution for Direct communications, resulting in an easier path for providers to achieve Meaningful Use Stage 2 attestation, and better healthcare outcomes for patients.”

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""Application provides simple steps to guide administrators in reconfiguring their MS Exchange servers to point to fully qualified domain names."">",<h1>DigiCert Internal Name Tool Helps Prepare Microsoft Exchange for New gTLDs</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2013-08-15-gtlds.htm,<title>Internal Name Tool &amp; gTLDs</title>,"<p>
			LEHI, UT (August 15, 2013) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading global authentication and encryption provider, helps network administrators prepare their security environments for ICANN’s pending release of new gTLDs with the DigiCert® Internal Name Tool for Microsoft Exchange (Internal Name Tool). The free SAAS application provides a step-by-step guide to help administrators reconfigure their MS Exchange 2013 and earlier version Exchange servers to point to fully qualified domain names (FQDN) – mitigating potential security risks posed by the new gTLDs.
		</p>,<p>
			Available to anyone, whether or not they are a DigiCert customer, the Internal Name Tool may be particularly beneficial for network administrators deploying <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/multi-domain-ssl.htm"">Unified Communications certificates</a> (UCC) as a way of securing multiple servers within the enterprise. The Certification Authority/Browser Forum (CA/B Forum) will require FQDNs for SANS on UC certificates by fall 2015. In 2011, the CA/B Forum deprecated issuance of certificates to internal names, which becomes effective following a multi-year phase-out period to allow companies time to update their systems. Furthermore, ICANN registration of new gTLDs ahead of Fall 2015 may pose additional risk to non-public domain extensions.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert continues to work within the CA/B Forum and with other industry bodies to advance standards and practices that enhance online security; we also recognize the continued value of flexible <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL Certificate</a> deployment for unified communications within organizations of all sizes,” said DigiCert Chief Technology Officer Paul Tiemann. “The DigiCert Internal Name Tool simplifies the compliance efforts of network security professionals, saving them time and money, as well as headache, as they reconfigure their Exchange servers to meet the new requirements and secure their most valuable data assets.”
		</p>,<p>
			Utilizing the Internal Name Tool not only can help administrators with their compliance goals but it gives them the peace of mind of knowing that the Internal Name tool automates the entire process, including changing minor settings with which they may not be familiar. The Internal Name Tool works for any Exchange environment and includes logging capabilities to provide full transparency to administrators.
		</p>,<p>
			For more information, see the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/internal-domain-name-tool.htm"">DigiCert Internal Name Tool</a> page. DigiCert is prepared to help organizations accommodate the changes brought on by the release of new gTLDs, including offering high-assurance certificates to new FQDNs to be registered with the new extensions.

			LEHI, UT (September 24, 2013) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading global authentication and encryption provider, announced today that it is the first Certificate Authority (CA) to implement Certificate Transparency (CT). DigiCert has been working with Google to pilot CT for more than a year and will begin adding <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL Certificates</a> to a public CT log by the end of October.
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert welcomes CT as an important step toward enhancing online trust. For several months, DigiCert has been working with Google engineers to test Google’s code, provide feedback on proposed CT implementations, and build CT support into the company’s systems. This initiative aligns with DigiCert’s focus to improve online trust—including tight internal security controls, development and adoption of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements and Network Security Guidelines, and participation in various industry bodies that are focused on security and trust standards.
		</p>,<p>
			“DigiCert’s business is built on trust, and we are committed to lead the industry toward better practices that enhance online security,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “Certificate Transparency accomplishes this goal by shining a light on certificate issuance practices and building in a scalable early detection system that relies upon trusted, widely used technologies and standards. We applaud Google for its forward-thinking mindset in advancing CT closer to implementation.”
		</p>,<p>
			CT provides early detection and mitigation of misissued or rogue SSL Certificates because it requires certificates to be posted to a public log. Google welcomes DigiCert’s efforts to advance CT adoption and awareness.
		</p>,<p>
			“We’re pleased to receive DigiCert’s declaration of support for CT and are encouraged by their continued work with us to help improve online trust and security,” said Ben Laurie, creator of CT and software security engineer at Google. “This is an important step that we hope other CAs will follow as we look to provide greater structural integrity to the SSL/TLS Certificate system.”

			RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. – Oct. 23, 2013 – <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sureclinical.com"">SureClinical™</a>, a leading provider of secure pharmaceutical and healthcare clinical content management solutions, announced today an exclusive partnership with <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert®</a>, a global leader in <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">authentication</a> and encryption services, to deliver the first FDA-compliant mobile signing service. The <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sureclinical.com/products/sureesign/"">SureEsign™</a> service is expected to revolutionize the way pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations handle clinical trial documentation, saving them time and money by eliminating manual paper-signing processes. 
		</p>,<p>
			Signatures created by DigiCert digital certificates can be used to verify both the source and integrity of a document. Entities using signed documents are assured the document is the original, unmodified version. DigiCert’s inclusion in the Adobe® Approved Trust List facilitates e-signing of Adobe® PDFs and the creation of digital IDs. A digital ID typically contains the signer’s name and e-mail address, the name of the organization that issued the certificate validating the ID, a serial number and an expiration date.
		</p>,<p>
			Using these certificates in connection with the SureEsign platform, a signer can execute Adobe PDF documents anytime and anywhere using SureClinical’s new, patent-pending two-factor signing authentication technology. This technology for mobile devices provides strong identification of signing parties and a highly secure environment. 
		</p>,<p>
			In the pharmaceutical market, the U.S. FDA (under FDA CFR 21 Part 11) requires digital certificate signatures on all documents submitted to its Electronic Submissions Gateway. SureEsign is the first signing service that supports FDA compliant digital certificate signing across organizational boundaries using mobile devices. SureEsign also complies with European Union Country Directives.
		</p>,<p>
			“Legacy signing solutions require companies to install and maintain expensive on-site server signing security hardware, signing software, and support services,” said SureClinical President and CEO Zack Schmidt. “These on-site signing services cannot support document signing operations beyond the firewall, limiting the use of digital certificate signing to in-house signing operations. With the new SureEsign platform, FDA clinical trial investigators, clinical research associates, sponsors and research organizations can use a mobile device to electronically sign FDA regulatory documents with their Adobe Digital ID anytime, anywhere.”  
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert’s <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.digicert.com/document-signing/"">document signing certificates</a> enable SureClinical to provision highly trusted digital signing services that can be viewed and verified in the latest versions of Adobe® Reader® and Adobe® Acrobat®.  		
		
		</p>,<p>
		“DigiCert is excited to be the exclusive provider of SureClinical’s document signing certificates,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “DigiCert’s experience with publicly trusted certificates and expertise in security means SureClinical is offering a secure and robust solution that is fully trusted by virtually all browsers and application software suites.”
		</p>,<p>
		Documents signed by the SureEsign platform contain a certificate credential that accurately identifies the individual signer. The signature is readily viewed and verified in SureClinical’s mobile, web or desktop clients, or in Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat. 
		</p>,<p>
		The SureEsign platform offers BioPharma and Healthcare organizations the following services:
		</p>,<p>
		•	Digital signing of office documents or medical images using highly trusted Adobe digital certificates</p>,<p>
		•	Viewing and instant validation of signed documents in Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat </p>,<p>
		•	Storage of digital IDs on U.S. NIST approved FIPS-140 level 3 compliant hardware security modules</p>,<p>
		•	Certifications for FDA, HIPAA, PCI, SSAE 16 Type II, and U.S. Safe Harbor/European Commission Privacy Directives</p>,<p>
		•	Integration of digital signing and workflow services with pharmacy and healthcare applications through the SureEsign open API

		</p>,<p>
		SureClinical’s SureEsign services are available as an optional module for the SureTrial eTMF cloud application and will be widely available beginning Q4 2013.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""DigiCert releases new Certificate Inspector tool to help identify and fix SSL certificate vulnerabilities."">",<h1>New DigiCert Certificate Inspector Helps Identify and Fix SSL Vulnerabilities</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2014-02-25-certificate-inspector.htm,<title>New Certificate Inspector from DigiCert</title>,"<p>
			LEHI, UT (February 25, 2014) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading global provider of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> and related online security products, today announced the availability of the DigiCert Certificate Inspector™. Designed to quickly find problems in certificate configuration and implementation, Certificate Inspector provides real-time analysis of an organization’s entire certificate landscape, including SSL termination endpoints. Using the tool, security professionals can discover forgotten, neglected or misconfigured certificates, and identify potential vulnerabilities, such as weak keys, problematic ciphers and expired certificates. For each potential threat detected, the tool provides a list of remediation activities.
		</p>,<p>
			SSL/TLS certificates are a key defense against unwanted surveillance of online user activity. Yet, too often system administrators fail to properly configure certificates, unknowingly leaving open vulnerabilities. Certificate Inspector scans the user’s network detecting all certificates in use, inspects SSL configuration and implementation, and then displays the results in an intuitive and interactive dashboard.
		</p>,<p>
			“By providing actionable information about certificate configuration and deployment status, combined with remediation tools, DigiCert helps organizations close the gap between certificate procurement and secure certificate deployment,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “The deployment of securely configured certificates is an important line of defense against unwelcomed surveillance. Certificate Inspector will help organizations shine a light on the areas within their network that could pose lurking threats. We believe that this tool can build upon the efforts of others in the security community to improve online trust in a new, tangible way.”
		</p>,<p>
			Keeping up with the latest security best practices as well as monitoring certificates is a daunting task, particularly for enterprises managing thousands of certificates. Frequently, manual tracking processes are used, which introduce human error and result in downtime or unknown security vulnerabilities such as configuration with cipher suites vulnerable to CRIME, BEAST, BREACH or other attacks. In other cases, departments outside of IT might deploy their own certificates, creating a blind spot for Administrators. This also can lead to configuration challenges that downgrade the effectiveness of the SSL certificates upon which organizations rely.
		</p>,<p>
			Certificate Inspector works on behalf of security professionals to bring lurking threats out of obscurity and help system administrators target and address problem areas.
		</p>,<p>
			Beginning today, security professionals can use the Certificate Inspector to:
			</p>,<p>
			Using a proprietary algorithm, the Certificate Inspector analyzes SSL certificates and termination endpoints for many security factors, including:
			</p>,<p>
			For each SSL certificate and termination endpoint, administrators receive a vulnerability report, a corresponding grade and a quick list of best practices for mitigating discovered weaknesses.
		</p>,<p>
			“The Certificate Inspector is just one of many steps that DigiCert is taking to improve online trust and help organizations best protect their data in motion,” said Hales. “With the input of our customers and others interested in optimum security, we’re working hard to provide the best SSL customer experience possible and advance internet security best practices.”
		</p>,<p>
			The Certificate Inspector is available to any security professional. To learn more about how to run reports and start optimizing their SSL configuration, administrators can visit <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/cert-inspector.htm"">https://www.digicert.com/cert-inspector.htm</a>.

			LEHI, UT (April 2, 2014) — DigiCert, Inc., a leading global provider of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> and related online security products, today announced that Vice President of Research &amp; Development Jason Sabin has been named a Utah Genius. In its sixth year, the Utah Genius awards program annually recognizes the top 20 patentees and trademark registrars in the state.

		</p>,<p>
			“Being named a Utah Genius is a major honor for Jason, and we congratulate him on this well-deserved recognition,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “We are grateful for Jason’s expertise in helping DigiCert lead the market with innovation that enhances our customers’ efforts to protect the integrity of their network operations.”

			LEHI, UT (June 11, 2014) — <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, today was named to the 2014 Online Trust Alliance (OTA) Honor Roll, marking three consecutive years the company has earned this distinction. The Honor Roll measures high-traffic websites for implementation of online security and privacy best practices. DigiCert is recognized for its continuing commitment to industry leadership in building, advocating and following best practices.
		</p>,<p>
			In developing the 2014 Honor Roll, the OTA surveyed 500 million e-mails and approximately 10,000 web pages, benchmarking security and privacy practices among the largest U.S. online retailers, banks, social networks, news media and federal government sites. Honor roll recipients were selected based on a comprehensive analysis including <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificate</a> implementation, privacy practices, e-mail authentication, and use of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ev-ssl-certification.htm"">Extended Validation SSL Certificates</a>.

			The language of the future is digital; and with emerging technologies, this future will include interconnected devices that automate the management of the appliances and devices we depend on every day.
		</p>,<p>
			We’re seeing the dawn of an era where even the most mundane items are communicating among themselves with little human interaction. Emerging technologies are turning the Internet of Things (IoT), into the Internet of Everything.
		</p>,<p>
			Your thermostat detects movement and automatically adjusts the temperature in your home. Over time it senses your preferences and learns when to turn on and off.  Your alarm clock can send a signal to your coffee pot and it starts brewing your morning coffee. As your car pulls into your driveway, your home disables the security system and unlocks the front door.
		</p>,<p>
			The Internet of Things brings to life a vision of the future where the more manual aspects of life can be automated so we can enjoy more meaningful living. Through widespread advancements in smart technologies, the time to a fully connected world is rapidly advancing. 
		</p>,<p>
			How we connect devices is changing how we work and live. While with the touch of a smart device we can manage the intricate details of our life, new security consequences complicate the capability of these devices.
		</p>,<p>
			Unsecured, smart devices counteract the convenience of the Internet of Things. Many advancements in technology today come without the consideration of potential threats; and without the proper security framework in place, the IoT enables new methods for home and privacy invasion.
		</p>,<p>
			As the Internet of Things become more commonplace in the devices we use daily, it will increase the number targets for data security threats.
		</p>,<p>
			And security threats to Internet of Things aren’t theoretical—they’re already happening. Recent attacks like the <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28208905"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“smart” light bulb password leaks</a>, <a href=""http://readwrite.com/2014/04/30/connected-home-hackers-stop-yelling-at-babies-foscam#feed=%2Fauthor%2Fadriana-lee&amp;awesm=~oGpJ6LXiUDKkdw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hacks of Foscam baby monitors</a>, <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/belkin-wemo-smart-home-networks-in-danger-of-hacks/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Belkin home automation systems</a>, and hacks of smart <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/01/technology/security/car-hack/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cars systems</a> are just the beginning. As the number of intelligent devices rises, the potential damage that could be caused by lack of security will continue to increase.
		</p>,<p>
			Because IoT is a relatively new field, device developers aren’t as experienced with security principals as existing software companies. 
		</p>,<p>
			This is also true for device manufacturers, home security system providers, home automation solutions providers, and industrial systems designers—all of whom have never dealt with the threats associated with data security in networked devices.
		</p>,<p>
			For over 20 years, PKI-based solutions have been securely exchanging information across the Internet and PKI usage has skyrocketed as companies are protecting more and more data. PKI is already being used to address problems similar to the ones the Internet of Things is likely to experience, as companies are using it to secure devices like mobile phones, tablets, printers, and WiFi hotspots.
		</p>,<p>
			As a leading Certificate Authority and PKI provider, DigiCert can help secure Internet of Things devices. And as a leader in SSL innovation, DigiCert is uniquely situated to meet the security needs of individuals and organizations as they develop new technologies for Internet of Things devices.
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert already provides Internet security products and services to over 80,000 customers in more than 180 countries. Over the last decade, DigiCert’s reputation for agile and rapid solution development to meet customer needs has made us the fastest growing Certificate Authority in the world. DigiCert has increasingly become the Certificate Authority of choice for emerging markets and for data encryption security in emerging technologies.
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert already secures devices for the government and scientific community and is poised to quickly deliver the digital certificates IoT manufacturers need in order to ensure proper data protection for their customers.
		</p>,<p>
			Using the existing DigiCert Certificate Management System, manufacturers can utilize automatic issuance of digital certificates for a wide array of devices. The managed certificate system can scale from small tests to full-range deployment in mass production and enables simple management throughout the certificate lifecycle. 
		</p>,<p>
			DigiCert engineers also consult with organizations to develop a custom deployment solution designed to work with their existing production infrastructures to add strong data security to their IoT devices.
		</p>,<p>
			Internet of Things device manufacturers and solutions providers can quickly begin using DigiCert managed certificate systems for Internet of things security. Where other digital certificate providers take days or weeks to set up managed accounts, DigiCert account managers can set up customers immediately—allowing you to begin deploying certificates to secure customer data and devices.

			LEHI, UT (September 4, 2014) — <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, today announced the availability of the new <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/https/"">DigiCert® Always-On SSL Site Checker</a>, a free online keyword tool to help search marketers analyze the impact SSL can have on their search rank results and determine how many competitor sites are using SSL to boost search rankings. 
		</p>,<p>
			Always-On SSL is a term that describes a practice of forcing SSL encryption by default across an entire website and not just pages where secure information is exchanged. Since Google announced on Aug. 6 that sites using SSL would receive an automatic search ranking boost, search marketers have been seeking the best way to use SSL as an advantage for site rank online.
		</p>,<p>
			Available now, the Always-On SSL checker ties into Google search APIs to produce a quick snapshot of the competitive keyword landscape and which sites already use or are migrating to HTTPS. Using the tool, a marketer can research a domain name’s current SSL status and current keywords associated with the domain, and also receive a report that includes:
		</p>,<p>
			“Google’s announcement to boost search rankings for sites using <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> is a positive step forward for user security and one that also is sure to have a long-term impact on search marketing,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “We’re mindful that the process of migrating sites to HTTPS requires search marketers to spend time learning more information about SSL certificates and evaluating how the use of SSL can improve visibility in Google search rankings. The Always-On SSL Site Checker saves marketers time by providing insights into their competitive keyword analysis with respect to how SSL is impacting search engine results.”
		</p>,<p>
			While the user security and customer engagement benefits of using Always-On SSL are recognized, Google’s new policy for search provides an added incentive for encrypting websites by boosting search rankings. For many marketers, learning how to efficiently and securely deploy certificates adds additional workload. DigiCert is introducing the new SSL site checker to help simplify the process by which organizations consider which sites to serve over HTTPS and where they can gain their greatest SEO advantage. As a value-add, the site checker provides quick links to help marketers learn how SSL works and which certificate types best suit their situation.
		</p>,<p>
			“With the growing rate of business that is done online today, it’s more important than ever that sites of all sizes take every necessary step to ensure they are optimized for good search rank positioning,” said DigiCert VP of Operations Flavio Martins.
		</p>,<p>
			Many large technology sites, including Twitter, PayPal, Facebook and Yahoo!, currently use Always-On SSL to protect their users from cross-site scripting, sidejacking and other attacks. These organizations have also reported that Always-On SSL can be achieved without measurable impacts to web speed and performance, thanks to today’s advanced computing systems. Furthermore, Always-On SSL builds trust in an organization’s brand among an increasingly security-conscious consumer base.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""Free DigiCert tool helps system admins analyze their use of SHA-1 hashing algorithms across all domains and subdomains—and map out a path for SHA-2 migration."">",<h1>DigiCert Releases Tool to Simplify SHA-2 Migration for System Administrators</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2014-09-17-sha-2-migration-tool.htm,<title>DigiCert SHA-2 Migration Tool</title>,"<p>
			LEHI, UT (Sept. 17, 2014) —<a href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, today released a free tool which helps system administrators analyze their use of SHA-1 hashing algorithms across all domains and subdomains—and map out a path for SHA-2 migration. Google’s Aug. 19 announcement that it would accelerate deprecation of SHA-1 certificates, including giving untrusted warnings to sites with SHA-1 certificates that expire in 2016, makes it necessary for many administrators to migrate to <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/transitioning-to-sha-2.htm"">SHA-2</a> by as early as November or risk their customers receiving downgraded trust indicators in Chrome.
		</p>,<p>
			Using the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/sha1-sunset/"">DigiCert® SHA-1 Sunset Tool</a>, administrators can determine validity periods for their SHA-1 <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm"">SSL certificates</a> and receive information about how Google’s new policy will affect user interaction with these certificates. DigiCert issues new certificates with SHA-2 by default and has done so for nearly a year. For those choosing to migrate their existing SHA-1 to a new DigiCert-issued SHA-2 certificate, DigiCert will provide a free replacement matching the length of the existing certificate licensing term, regardless of whether or not they are a DigiCert customer.  
		</p>,<p>
			“With the busy holiday shopping season nearing and the threat of a downgraded user trust experience looming for Chrome users, DigiCert is taking extra steps to help ease the burden of accelerated SHA-2 migration timelines for administrators,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “Our new SHA-1 Sunset Tool saves time and effort by providing a comprehensive analysis of an organization’s certificate landscape, including where SHA-1 certificates exist, which software and hardware support SHA-2, and a review of how Google’s new timelines may affect any given site. We also understand that SHA-2 migration involves costly system and device upgrades for organizations and so we’re offering to match for free the remaining term of any existing SHA-1 certificate that is converted to SHA-2.” 
		</p>,<p>
			Some key timelines are important to keep in mind regarding Google's SHA-1 deprecation:
		</p>,<p>
			<span style=""color:red;"">Updated:</span> Additionally, Microsoft has announced the following SHA-1 deprecation timelines:

            <b>*Note:</b>  For details concerning Microsoft's support for SHA-1 Code Signing Certificates, please refer to the Windows PKI blog posting <a href=""http://blogs.technet.com/b/pki/archive/2013/11/12/sha1-deprecation-policy.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">SHA1 Deprecation Policy</a>.
        </p>,<p>
			In addition to receiving a full report of their current SHA-1 deployment across all domains via the SHA-1 Sunset Tool, administrators can take advantage of other DigiCert tools and features to optimize their certificate deployment. DigiCert customers can use a built-in feature to their customer accounts to monitor SHA-2 migrations as they take place, in real-time, using the SHA-1 Sunset Tool. They also can use their account to issue new certificates and benefit from free reissues at any time. Non-DigiCert customers can access the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/cert-inspector.htm"">DigiCert Certificate Inspector</a> to review real-time SSL certificate and endpoint deployment across internal and external networks and identify areas for improvement, including flagging SHA-1 certificates and expiration dates.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""SecureWiFi Certificates authorized for Release 2 of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™ Passpoint® Program point toward better, more secure Wi-Fi user experience."">",<h1>DigiCert Announces Availability of SecureWifi Certificates™</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2014-10-09-securewifi-certificates.htm,<title>DigiCert Announces Availability of SecureWifi Certificates</title>,"<p>
			LEHI, UT (Oct. 9, 2014) — <a href=""https://www.digicert.com"">DigiCert, Inc.</a>, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, today announced the availability of new <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/wifi/"">SecureWifi Certificates</a>, which are trusted by the Wi-Fi Alliance to authenticate and encrypt online signup servers compliant with Release 2 of its Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Passpoint program. As one of just two certificate authorities included in Release 2 of the Passpoint certification program for devices, DigiCert is a full-service provider and provides certificates to Wi-Fi chipset manufacturers, service providers, and access point vendors looking to participate in Passpoint. Additionally, authorized certificates from DigiCert can help retail and hospitality providers deploy Passpoint-certified networks at retail and hotel locations around the world.
		</p>,<p>
			“Today’s announcement is an important step toward the future and ultimate realization of secure Wi-Fi being made available everywhere,” said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. “With Passpoint Release 2, equipment manufacturers and vendors can build the next-generation systems that will enable secure online connections for new account provisioning, authentication for Wi-Fi hotspots to reduce the risk of spoofing, and an overall improved, more secure Wi-Fi user experience.”
		</p>,<p>
			Passpoint Release 2 features closes some of the traditional gaps in hotspot security by provisioning online signup servers with an authorized digital certificate to authenticate the access point with the service provider’s uniquely identifying common name and the provider’s logo. This helps avoid user confusion and reduces the likelihood of a user falling prey to access point spoofing. Additionally, the use of an authorized certificate encrypts information exchanged during the signup process, helping to protect user’s credentials when registering for a new account.
		</p>,<p>
			By streamlining the process for creating a new user account at the point of access, Passpoint helps to reduce barriers to account creation and usage for service providers. Likewise, it reduces the complexity for users in getting connected and enables them to re-connect easily across a service provider’s broad network of hotspots with the trust that their credentials are securely exchanged when connecting.
		</p>,<p>
			The availability of <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/wifi/how-wifi-certificates-work.htm"">SecureWifi Certificates</a>, and subsequent work that DigiCert plans within the Wi-Fi Alliance in the coming future, represent an important step forward toward a vision of enabling secure wi-fi everywhere. With continued advancements in future Passpoint programs, the potential exists to enable globally available, authenticated hotspot access points and devices that are easily identifiable and provisioned with end-to-end encryption. It also provides a path forward that may lead to expansion of global Wi-Fi roaming that reduces cellular data overload and demand for new cellular tower construction.
		</p>,<p>
			Mobile equipment vendors, operators and hospitality providers looking to participate in Release 2 features of the Passpoint program need to use an authorized digital certificate for certification. As the only publicly trusted Certificate Authority authorized for Release 2 of Passpoint, DigiCert invites participants to experience the <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/welcome/why-choose-digicert.htm"">DigiCert Difference</a>™, which includes award-winning customer support, a host of products and tools to simplify and optimize digital certificate management, and fast negotiation of secure sessions designed for the speed of mobile business.

            ""DigiCert is honored by this recognition of our continued efforts to work with our enterprise customers to help them more simply and securely manage the SSL certificate management lifecycle,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""The DigiCert Certificate Inspector helps enterprises identify and inventory SSL Certificates on internal and external networks, and fix potential vulnerabilities caused by expired certificates, poor cipher suite configuration on their servers, or potentially outdated practices such as the use of SHA-1 or SSL 3 and earlier protocols.""
        </p>,<p>
            Continued Sabin, ""Today's security professionals manage hundreds, if not thousands, of certificates across their network and many times work in disparate physical locations.

            LEHI, UT (April 14, 2015) — DigiCert, a leader in <a href=""/ssl-certificate.htm"" target=""_blank"">SSL Certificate</a> trust, today is announcing new ways to automate SSL certificate installation and server configuration while helping enterprises detect certificate fraud. Certificate Monitoring parses data from Google Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and proprietary DigiCert systems to give enterprises unparalleled insight into certificates issued for their domains, along with phishing detection. Express Install, unlike any other utility available, simplifies and automates SSL installation and server configuration for Windows servers and top Linux distributions.
        </p>,<p>
            <a href=""/certificate-monitoring/"" target=""_blank"">Certificate Monitoring</a> identifies and helps stop unauthorized SSL Certificates and protects brand IP by providing a comprehensive overview of all SSL Certificates issued for a given domain and its variants. Using Certificate Monitoring, organizations enter owned domains (and variants) to identify unauthorized SSL Certificates and possible phishing attempts. Administrators can receive e-mail alerts when certificates are issued for their domains. Certificate Monitoring is the first operational service of its type in the market, in part available because DigiCert operates the only non-Google, approved CT log.
        </p>,<p>
            Created with the system administrator or IT manager in mind, DigiCert's <a href=""/express-install/"" target=""_blank"">Express Install</a> automates the installation and configuration of SSL Certificates, reducing the complexity, hassle, and time to enable HTTPS. It also reduces the typical configuration errors associated with manual processes. Unlike any tool now or planned to become available on the market, Express Install is compatible with Windows servers and top Linux distributions for Apache server support. Express Install also supports all certificate types, including wildcard, multi-domain and EV SSL.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Our express installation and certificate monitoring systems are the result of continued efforts to enhance online trust while also addressing our customers' needs for consolidated, simplified certificate lifecycle management,"" said DigiCert Chief Security Officer Jason Sabin. ""Certificate Monitoring and Express Install give administrators insight into the security of their domains, and also replace many of the time-consuming and error-prone tasks related to certificate installation and management.""
        </p>,<p>
            Consistent with its quest to simplify the process of enabling Always-on SSL, DigiCert Express Install reduces installation and server configuration to a matter of clicks. Using Express Install eliminates the barriers and complexities of setting up secure servers and HTTPS-enabled Websites.
        </p>,<p>
            Now in beta, the DigiCert CertCentral™ platform consolidates enterprise certificate management, with Certificate Monitoring, Express Install and the award-winning DigiCert Certificate Inspector™, which helps organizations quickly inventory all SSL certificates across internal and external networks. Using smart sensors, Certificate Inspector helps identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities and non-compliant certificates, and also provides remediation tips. Together, these new features from DigiCert represent a major step forward for online trust and digital certificate management.
        </p>,<p>

            LEHI, UT (June 4, 2015) — DigiCert, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, has partnered with Plex, the leading personal media streaming solution, to provide publicly trusted certificates to enhance security for all Plex media streaming and cloud services. DigiCert's SSL/TLS Internet of Things (IoT) solution will allow Plex to provide end-to-end security for tens of millions of Plex media servers and clients.
        </p>,<p>
            ""With the rapid expansion of supported devices and significant user growth, security is a top priority for Plex,"" said Plex Chief Product Officer Scott Olechowski. ""Times have changed. To adapt, we are rolling out DigiCert encryption and security to every server and client. This will counteract possible attacks, hacks, or snooping and provide all of our users with the trusted 'green lock' for each of their devices and platforms.""
        </p>,<p>
            The security provided by DigiCert to Plex and their customers will be one of the largest implementations of publicly trusted certificates to date. DigiCert and Plex will be utilizing existing PKI technologies and SSL/TLS encryption to create a scalable, secure solution to protect the communications between Plex-enabled devices.
        </p>,<p>
            ""By partnering with DigiCert, Plex is providing customers with additional peace of mind with layers of security that go beyond today's industry norm,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""Each Plex Media Server will now get its own unique, high-assurance <a href=""/ssl-certificate.htm"" target=""_blank"">SSL Certificate</a>, enabling the client to securely browse and play back content using the strongest encryption available. Users simply sign in and safely connect to their media no matter where they are.""
        </p>,<p>
            Plex selected DigiCert based on its proven ability to deliver custom, innovative, and scalable solutions for securing IoT devices and to integrate with existing management platforms. The complex nature of the deployment requires a unique digital certificate and private key for each individual streaming media server.

DigiCert received its award at the 13<sup>th</sup> Annual American Business Awards gala held in San Francisco this past weekend.
        </p>,<p>
            Certificate Monitoring™ is the latest innovation from DigiCert, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, and is designed to simplify digital certificate management. Certificate Monitoring, launched this past April as the first service of its kind, helps organizations audit all certificates issued for their domains to enforce security policies, and defend against rogue and unauthorized <a href=""/ssl-certificate.htm"" target=""_blank"">SSL/TLS Certificate</a> issuance.
        </p>,<p>
            ""We're honored to receive this award as a result of the many security professionals who voted for Certificate Monitoring,"" said DigiCert CEO Nicholas Hales. ""In a hyper-connected world in which organizations face evolving threats, providing <a href=""/certificate-monitoring/"" target=""_blank"">continuous certificate monitoring</a> through Google's Certificate Transparency and related initiatives helps protect organizations and users from unauthorized certificate issuance, whether that be by negligence or fraud.""
        </p>,<p>
            Cloud-based, Certificate Monitoring™ accesses millions of public certificate records from Google's <a href=""/certificate-transparency/"" target=""_blank"">Certificate Transparency (CT)</a>, DigiCert's CT log and other sources to present all discoverable certificates in one interface. The DigiCert log was the first non-Google operated one approved for CT and has been in use since late 2014. Using Certificate Monitoring, administrators can identify possible phishing attempts and other fraudulent schemes, safeguarding user trust and protecting against attacks.
        </p>,<p>
            Certificate Monitoring™ is one component of DigiCert's industry-leading <a href=""/lifecycle/"" target=""_blank"">certificate lifecycle management</a> system, <a href=""/certcentral/"" target=""_blank"">CertCentral®</a>, a new innovative platform created to consolidate certificate monitoring, SSL deployment, certificate inspection, and PKI management.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""DigiCert's CertCentral® named a finalist for Internet of Things (IoT) Security Product Excellence"">",<h1>DigiCert CertCentral<sup>®</sup> Named Finalist for IoT Security Global Excellence Award </h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2016-01-19-digicert-iot-security-product-awards-finalist.htm,<title>DigiCert IoT Security Product Excellence Awards Finalist</title>,"<p>
            LEHI, UT (January 19, 2016) — DigiCert, a global SSL Certification Authority (CA) and the leading provider of trusted certificate management solutions, announced that its certificate platform <a href=""/certcentral/"" target=""_blank"">CertCentral</a><sup>®</sup> has been named a finalist for Internet of Things (IoT) Security Product Excellence. Winners will be announced at the Info Security Products Guide's 12<sup>th</sup> Annual Global Excellence Awards, to be held on February 29 in San Francisco, in conjunction with the start of the annual RSA security conference.
        </p>,<p>
            CertCentral handles all aspects of the digital <a href=""/lifecycle/"" target=""_blank"">certificate management</a> lifecycle in one intuitive, cloud-based portal that is capable of supporting active deployment of billions of certificates simultaneously. A rapidly increasing number of major IoT companies are using the platform to embed security into current and next-generation internet-connected products.
        </p>,<p>
            ""The IoT demands smart, optimized security solutions at enormous scales, and CertCentral does this for organizations by simplifying certificate management and automating critical tasks,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""We're honored by this recognition and excited about the growing number of popular IoT platforms, manufacturers, and leading organizations that are working with us to authenticate and encrypt smart devices and systems to gain a competitive edge.""
        </p>,<p>
            The IoT era spurs exponential growth in the number of connected devices and objects but also increases the attack vector for malicious parties looking to exploit the lack of basic security controls such as authentication and encryption. According to Gartner, ""public key infrastructure (PKI) will re-emerge as one of the most relevant authentication mechanisms for organizations to address the IOT authentication problem. PKI's flexibility is important when changing requirements and represent identity in a cross-platform, multiprotocol approach...Gartner predicts that discovery, provisioning, authentication and data protection will account for half of all security spend in the next five years."" <sup>1</sup>
        </p>,<p>
            To fulfill its promise, the IoT market must implement PKI correctly. Episodes such as Heartbleed serve as reminders of the importance of enterprises not only deploying digital certificates at-scale but being ready to execute real-time updates of all TLS termination points across the network.
        </p>,<p>
            DigiCert's CertCentral helps organizations maximize their IoT brand investments by simplifying certificate deployment and management through automation and best-in-class innovation. CertCentral automation and real-time insights help reduce human errors and the hours spent on manual processes. CertCentral closes the security gaps often caused by negligence, ignorance or rogue actions of employees not authorized to issue certificates by IT.
        </p>,<p>
            CertCentral addresses all aspects of the certificate management lifecycle, including:
        </p>,<p>
            With OCSP response times for TLS/SSL Certificates more than four times faster than competitors, DigiCert certificates are the clear choice for performance-minded enterprises working in the IoT. As a result, DigiCert continues to attract the business of the world's leading brands, including six of the global Alexa Top 10, major IoT platform providers and global technology companies.

This translates to more secure Internet of Things (IoT) and web deployments, enabling fast page and application load times with reliable certificate verification.
        </p>,<p>
            Recent reports from Netcraft show that DigiCert OCSP response times are up to eight times faster than the average response across the CA industry.

            ""Digital certificates are growing in use as a critical backbone to ensuring web user privacy and security by authenticating websites, smart devices and <a href=""/internet-of-things/"" target=""_blank"">IoT</a> deployments, and encrypting data in transit,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""The need for speedy but secure deployments increases as businesses look to grow their consumer base via mobile and IoT deployments. Fast OCSP served over the edge helps to meet consumer expectations of nearly instantaneous page loads while providing essential security.""
        </p>,<p>
            DigiCert enables fast certificate verification checking by working with leading content distribution networks (CDNs) to serve OCSP responses over the edge. The company also geolocates OCSP response servers to shorten the distance that validation checks need to travel, helping assure consistently fast, secure page loads anywhere in the world.
        </p>,<p>
            In addition to enabling the IoT, DigiCert's <a href=""https://blog.digicert.com/ocsp-times-and-what-they-mean-for-you/"" target=""_blank"">fast OCSP</a> response times are supporting collaborative research initiatives made possible by international grid supercomputing. Fast, secure connections are key to researchers being able to collaborate in real-time via connected networks. Large-scale, certificate-based authentication and encryption helps researchers across multiple global universities and labs confidently share key findings and work together to solve some of the world's most pressing issues.
        </p>,<p>
            A few of the projects supported by DigiCert-secured grids include the Large Hadron Collider, cancer research, deep space exploration via the European Space Agency's Copernicus program, studies examining glacier melt and the effects of climate change, and collaboration to improve economic development across geopolitical boundaries.

            SANTA MONICA, Calif., (December 13, 2016) — Today, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.airmap.com"">AirMap</a> announced Drone ID, a partnership with <a target=""_blank"" href=""/"">DigiCert</a> that will enable, for the first time, instant authentication of an unmanned aircraft's identity via a digital certificate.  Drone ID is a major step forward for drone security, laying the groundwork for a future in which millions of drones can share the airspace safely and efficiently.
        </p>,<p>
            Drone ID is a publicly-trusted SSL/TLS certificate issued by AirMap and DigiCert. Drone operators that register their drone online will receive a digital Drone ID certificate, including a unique, validated aircraft identity number that can be loaded onto the drone and shared with others in the drone ecosystem. Drone ID will first be available for drones built with the <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.intel.com/aero"">Intel® Aero Platform for Developers</a>, including the Intel Aero Ready to Fly Drone.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Think of Drone ID like any form of identification you have in your wallet,"" AirMap Chief Information Security Officer Jared Ablon said. ""If you show your driver's license at airport security, they don't need to call the DMV to verify. Drone ID works the same way, providing drones with an aircraft identity that has been authenticated by trusted authorities.""
        </p>,<p>
            Drone ID is the first program of its kind, and a necessary step towards achieving efficient and secure communication from drone to drone, between drones and other aircraft, and with platforms providing airspace information and services. When an aircraft with Drone ID shares its identity, there is no need to query a third party to verify, enabling more efficient data exchange between airspace stakeholders.
        </p>,<p>
            Drone ID will be certified by AirMap and DigiCert, a security solutions provider that provides scalable identity, authentication and encryption for web servers and other connected devices. DigiCert provides high-volume certificate issuance and management for leading organizations in healthcare, technology, industrial operations, finance, manufacturing, education, transportation, telecommunications and government.
        </p>,<p>
            ""AirMap's partnership with DigiCert brings a new level of security to the drone ecosystem,"" AirMap CTO Daniel Rubio said. ""Identity verification – delivered by Drone ID – is a critical part of the airspace infrastructure that will support drone operations at scale and bring countless benefits to our everyday lives.""
        </p>,<p>
            ""The growing number of connected devices in our world requires scalable security solutions that use identity, strong authentication and encryption,"" said DigiCert CTO Dan Timpson. ""Our work with AirMap is advancing secure drone operations and aircraft safety into a new era and is part of our focus across all industries to serve the security needs of new and emerging markets, including the Internet of Things.""
        </p>,<p>
            Drone ID will be available in the first quarter of 2017. Developers who purchases an Intel Aero Ready to Fly Drone or the Intel Aero Compute Board will be the first to have the opportunity to register for Drone ID.
        </p>,<p>
            AirMap is the world's leading airspace management platform for unmanned aircraft, commonly known as drones. Developed by experts in drone technology, aviation, and policy, AirMap delivers accurate, reliable, and trustworthy low-altitude navigational data and communication tools to the drone industry: inventors of drones &amp; drone technology, drone operators, and airspace stakeholders.

            LEHI, UT (June 14, 2016) — DigiCert, a leading global Certificate Authority and provider of trusted identity and authentication services, has been named to the 2016 Online Trust Alliance (OTA) Honor Roll, marking the fifth consecutive year the company has been recognized for its leadership in online security and privacy.
        </p>,<p>
            Each year, the Honor Roll audits the top online retailers, FDIC banks, consumer services, media/news outlets and U.S. federal government sites to determine adoption of online security and privacy best practices. For its part, DigiCert not only advocates high standards for SSL/TLS authentication and encryption but also follows strict security practices for its own systems.
        </p>,<p>
            ""OTA commends DigiCert not only for achieving the Honor Roll for the fifth consecutive year, but more importantly, its commitment to collaboration in both the public and private sector"", said Online Trust Alliance CEO and Executive Director Craig Spiezle. ""Through DigiCert's support of OTA and active participation in industry working groups, the company continues to help re-define site security and responsible privacy practices.""
        </p>,<p>
            The increasing connectivity of global economies associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) is adding urgency for organizations to ensure strong device authentication and encryption of data in transit. This includes networked medical devices, home automation systems, manufacturing, industrial operations, automobiles and other critical infrastructure. Public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital certificates help limit device access to the authorized parties and ensure message integrity through secure signing services. Certificates also authenticate secure bootup, enrollment and updates to IoT devices. DigiCert's combination of smart automation to simplify certificate management with high-assurance identity validation helps lead to a more trustworthy IoT and web.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Connected devices and systems are expanding rapidly, but too many times they fail to implement proper authentication, encryption and messaging signing to ensure trust and integrity of data,"" said DigiCert CSO Jason Sabin. ""The OTA Honor Roll is an important annual benchmark to help companies measure up to the high standards that are required for a safe web and economy. It also aids consumers by giving them insight into the organizations that most value their security and privacy. DigiCert is honored to be recognized for our efforts to uphold the highest standards in data and system protection and to support OTA's efforts to raise the bar for all industries.""
        </p>,<p>
            Now in its eighth year, the Online Trust Audit and Honor Roll is the only comprehensive, independent online trust benchmarking study. The Honor Roll surveys more than 400 million e-mail headers, 1,000 privacy policies and approximately 10,000 web pages. Benchmarking the security and privacy practices of top private and public sector websites, the Honor Roll evaluates important security hygiene practices including <a href=""/ssl-certificate.htm"" target=""_blank"">SSL certificate</a>/TLS implementation, privacy policies, e-mail authentication, and use of <a href=""/ev-ssl-certification.htm"" target=""_blank"">Extended Validation SSL Certificates</a>.
        </p>,<p>
            Started in 2008 as an effort to drive adoption of best practices, its objectives are to 1) recognize leadership and commitment to best practices which aid in the protection of online trust and confidence in online services, 2) enable businesses to enhance their security, data protection and privacy practices, 3) move from compliance to stewardship, demonstrating support of meaningful self-regulation, and 4) promote security &amp; privacy as part of a company's brand promise and value proposition.
        </p>,<p>
            The Online Trust Alliance (OTA) is a non-profit with the mission to enhance online trust and user empowerment while promoting innovation and the vitality of the Internet. Its goal is to help educate businesses, policy makers and stakeholders while developing and advancing best practices and tools to enhance the protection of users' security, privacy and identity. OTA supports collaborative public-private partnerships, benchmark reporting, and meaningful self-regulation and data stewardship. Its members and supporters include leaders spanning the public policy, technology, ecommerce, social networking, mobile, email and interactive marketing, financial, service provider, government agency and industry organization sectors.

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""DigiCert has made their new Enterprise SSL Certificate Management system available, allowing account administrators greater degrees of control over certificate issuance and management."">",<h1>DigiCert Managed PKI Enterprise Certificate Management</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/managed-pki-services.htm,<title>DigiCert Press Release :: Managed PKI Services Now Available</title>,"<p>
			LINDON, UT (August 3, 2010) - DigiCert, Inc., a leading provider of Authentication &amp; Encryption services, now offers Managed Public Key Infrastructure 
			(PKI),
			a service that empowers customers who require a high SSL certificate volume to take control of certificate management. Managed PKI allows organizations to 
			perform key life-cycle events of SSL certificates on demand.
		</p>,<p>	
			SSL certificates encrypt the transfer of sensitive online information and protect that information from outside parties. From online shopping to secure 
			email messages or even private health records, SSL certificates have a wide variety of applications in any industry. 
		</p>,<p>	
			With DigiCert's Managed PKI service, issuing new SSL certificates and reissuing, replacing, or revoking existing certificates is instantaneous since both
			the organization and the domain are pre-validated. Organizations can now efficiently manage their certificates without the wait normally associated with 
			retail certificate orders. 
		</p>,<p>	
			Managed PKI allows customers to have multiple sub-accounts, thus distributing workload while centralizing control. Designated Administrative Users can submit 
			certificate requests and also approve or reject requests submitted by Limited Users. Authority levels for users can be changed at any time and customers 
			can set up as many Administrative Users as needed, therefore increasing certificate issuing speeds. Additionally, business units can be created so that 
			certificate requests can be associated with organizational departments, such as Sales or Marketing, for internal auditing or billing procedures.
		</p>,<p>	
			Certificate sub-accounts can also be shared among business units. If a business unit, such as Marketing, needs access to test.example.com and there is an existing 
			certificate for that domain issued to Sales, then an Administrative User can give Marketing access to that existing certificate without having to create a new account. 
			All account activity is recorded in an audit log so that every action is tracked with pertinent details that are searchable by user or by date.
		</p>,<p>	
			""DigiCert's Managed PKI service is a huge time saver, both for me as an Administrative User and for the users I support,"" says Brian Wilson, Network 
			Security Engineer at SAS. ""The workflow features have been particularly welcome. For example, the ability to assign multiple owners - which means a 
			certificate can be renewed even when its original creator is not available - reduces headaches and delays. DigiCert not only costs us less, but it 
			provides a better MPKI experience than our previous provider.""
		</p>,<p>	
			Funds are deposited into Managed PKI accounts by purchase order or credit card and treated like cash. All approved certificate requests are 
			automatically deducted from the account balance and the deposited funds never expire. In addition to these great features, Managed PKI users 
			enjoy all the benefits of being a DigiCert customer: free 24-hour support, free reissues, unlimited server licensing, low prices, and much more.
		</p>,<p>	
			According to Augustus Sam, Senior Network Engineer at the University of Maryland, DigiCert's Managed PKI has been a great benefit. ""Managed PKI from 
			DigiCert is a great fit for our university,"" Sam said. ""We get to keep the extremely helpful and responsive support that DigiCert is known for while 
			also gaining the ability to manage our certificates as we choose. The online system is easy to use and has simplified everything for us. Managed PKI 
			is smart, fast, and extremely affordable.""
		</p>,<p>	
			SSL Plus, Unified Communications (SAN), and Extended Validation (EV) certificates are all available and manageable from the Managed PKI system. 
			DigiCert strives to provide the best products and service possible to its customers, and Managed PKI further helps to achieve that goal. DigiCert is 
			also dedicated to providing free tools that enable administrators to get the most out of its high-strength encryption. Robust security controls and 
			strict adherence to SSL standards, all verified by WebTrust, combined with strong encryption, solidify DigiCert's position as a leading provider of 
			authentication and encryption services. To find out more about Managed PKI or to request a complimentary demonstration, visit

"<meta name=""DESCRIPTION"" content=""DigiCert launces automated service provisions credentials on IoT devices lacking open enrollment protocols"">",<h1>DigiCert Launches Digital Certificate Auto-Provisioning for IoT Devices</h1>,https://www.digicert.com/news/2017-02-06-digicert-launches-auto-provisioning-for-iot-devices.htm,<title>DigiCert Launces Auto-Provisioning | digicert.com</title>,"<p>
            LAS VEGAS, NV, (February 6, 2017) — DigiCert, a global leader in scalable authentication and encryption solutions, unveiled DigiCert Auto-Provisioning, powered by Device Authority, this past weekend at the DigiCert Security Summit. With Auto-Provisioning, connected device manufacturers and owners can provision digital certificates at scale, whether their devices use open standards such as SCEP or EST, or only support propriety device enrollment protocols.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Device authentication and encryption are critical to securing connected devices and the information they share, but many software implementations lack standard protocols for provisioning devices,"" said DigiCert CTO Dan Timpson. ""DigiCert Auto-Provisioning, powered by Device Authority, helps companies get certificates on a much wider range of IoT devices in a scalable, secure and automated way.""
        </p>,<p>
            As the number of connected devices rises toward an estimated 50 billion by 2020, security continues to lag behind. A study published by HP Fortify estimated that three-quarters of connected devices failed to encrypt communications to the Internet and local network. Last year, researchers found that Nissan Leaf smartphone app APIs were not authenticating users on the server. Similarly, in 2015, researchers highlighted a flaw in Samsung’s smart fridge that attackers could use to carry out a man-in-the-middle attack and access a homeowner's credentials.
        </p>,<p>
            In healthcare, the FDA has recently issued ""Postmarket Management of Cyber Security in Medical Devices,"" even as security vulnerabilities have been discovered in popular pacemakers, defibrillators and diabetes insulin pumps. The report calls for ""deploying mitigations that address cyber risk early."" Public key infrastructure (PKI) can be used for secure boot, patch management, machine-to-machine mutual authentication, user authentication, and data integrity to help prevent unauthorized intrusions and data manipulation.
        </p>,<p>
            IoT devices often lack the compute power required for strong encryption and do not have the ability to securely generate and store keys required for strong device security. Similarly, when credentials need to be revoked or rotated because of device authorization changes, the process is typically manual, time-consuming and vulnerable to human error. DigiCert Auto-Provisioning combines scalable certificate issuance with automated provisioning to simplify large-volume device enrollment and credentialing. It also provides secure key generation and storage to prevent the use of stolen credentials and unauthorized devices.
        </p>,<p>
            DigiCert Auto-Provisioning expands the range and type of IoT devices that can be secured, enabling certificate deployment and management at scale through:
        </p>,<p>
            Concluded Timpson, ""Companies now have the ability to assert owner-controlled PKI on a much wider spectrum of connected devices to strengthen security controls. Using this solution, companies can take a major step forward in securing their IoT investments, becoming less dependent on manufacturer security.""

            LAS VEGAS, NV (Nov. 19, 2015) — Security is getting better as awareness improves and organizations invest more in protecting data, but the industry needs further collaboration to improve the usability of security solutions for enterprises and end-users. That was the predominant theme security experts told attendees at the annual DigiCert Security Summit, held in Las Vegas Nov. 12 and 13. Conference-goers gathered to discuss best practices for Internet of Things (IoT), enterprise, cloud and browser security. Discussions included the essential role of public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital <a href=""/lifecycle/lifecycle-features.htm"" target=""_blank"">certificate management</a> in protecting the massive amounts of data traversing the Internet in the IoT market.

            Cigital Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and co-founder of the Building Security in Maturity Model (BSIMM) Gary McGraw told the audience that the rules have changed, as there is no defined perimeter in cloud computing models, but that he is optimistic in the growing investment in 'security by design' within organizations. Meanwhile, security researcher and TOR contributor Runa Sandvik emphasized the need for better user education and simplification of security in her efforts to help journalists protect their sources. Sandvik said these principles apply to all endeavors to secure connected communications.
        </p>,<p>
            ""If we want people to be safer online, we need to find tools and methods that already fit within users' workflows,"" said Sandvik. ""If we try to force them to change how they work, they won't use it.""
        </p>,<p>
            Many of the discussions at the Security Summit focused on protecting data in the era of the <a href=""/internet-of-things/iot-security-challenge.htm"" target=""_blank"">IoT</a>, as the number of connected objects and devices is expected to increase exponentially in the next five years. DigiCert Chief Security Officer (CSO) Jason Sabin spoke of the company's investment in helping organizations efficiently deploy and manage large quantities of digital certificates to provide strong device authentication and encryption of data in transit.
        </p>,<p>
            ""The IoT introduces a new scale for security, one that we're prepared to help organizations efficiently implement,"" said Sabin. ""We've successfully tested our systems to handle deployment of billions of certificates. As the first to operate a Google Certificate Transparency log, our platforms have access to monitor 35 million certificates, giving organizations real-time access to their entire certificate landscape, to make sure they are following best practices and optimizing their deployments and configurations.""
        </p>,<p>
            One of the areas most affected by the IoT is healthcare, where the consequences of connecting networked medical devices with inherent security flaws, or devices that are not properly configured, may prove more catastrophic than in other industries. At the Security Summit, DigiCert brought together a panel featuring Protiviti Associate Director Scott Erven, a security researcher who has spent several years researching medical device vulnerabilities, alongside Royal Philips Global Product Security &amp; Services Officer Michael McNeil, and GE Healthcare Principal Security Consultant Dan Birtwhistle. The panel, moderated by DigiCert VP of Healthcare Solutions Mike Nelson, also included Plex Founder &amp; Chief Product Officer Scott Olechowski, who addressed his company's recent work to provide TLS protection to all of its customers, <a href=""/news/2015-06-04-plex-partners-with-digicert.htm"" target=""_blank"">deploying certificates across tens of millions of devices and servers</a>.
        </p>,<p>
            Erven told conference attendees that securing networked medical devices is a shared responsibility between device manufacturers and the healthcare clinics, hospitals and other facilities that use them.
        </p>,<p>
            McNeil and Birtwhistle both emphasized that manufacturers are prioritizing security and addressing areas of improvement. They said that security is good for business and is now becoming part of the procurement requirements they see from healthcare organizations.
        </p>,<p>
            Erven said device manufacturers have to balance device functionality with security considerations and that sometimes these considerations make for tough decisions. The involvement of large manufacturers in providing responsible vulnerability disclosure policies is a positive step in the right direction.
        </p>,<p>
            Improving browser security begins with focusing on basic certificate implementation errors, according to Google Software Engineer Emily Stark, who spoke at the Security Summit. Stark told attendees that 17 percent of certificate errors in Chrome happen when users have bad clocks on their machines. This includes buggy antivirus software that often alters operating system clocks upon install. Additionally, many organizations' certificates fail because they include mismatched names in their certificate chains – something free online checkers such as the <a href=""/help/"" target=""_blank"">DigiCert SSL Installation Tool</a> can detect.
        </p>,<p>
            Stark also spoke about projects such as Google Certificate Transparency (CT) and Public Key Pinning that improve online trust. She highlighted new information to be provided in the developer tools security panel in upcoming versions of Chrome as well as new security warning messages.
        </p>,<p>
            Continuing on this theme, White Ops Chief Scientist and researcher Dan Kaminsky demonstrated practical security improvements in the browser to, for the 'first time' in his career, defeat clickjacking attacks. Kaminsky said, ""This is the anti-hack. Security is working for the browser instead of against it.""
        </p>,<p>
            To keep up with evolving security threats, industry must collaborate to strengthen policies, improve trustworthiness and introduce new technologies that meet the needs of the IoT and emerging markets, said DigiCert Vice President of Business Development &amp; Legal Jeremy Rowley at the Security Summit. Rowley spoke of several industry initiatives advanced by DigiCert to improve security, including leading the industry in implementing Google's CT in the company's systems and operating the first independent log trusted by Google. The DigiCert log recently captured a large case of certificate misissuance that was publicized by Google. DigiCert is pushing for CT logging to be required for DV and OV certificates as well.
        </p>,<p>
            Rowley also mentioned DigiCert's support for Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA), which allows domain operators to specify which CAs they trust to issue for their domains, and a recent ballot proposed by DigiCert in the CA/Browser Forum to allow for so-called short-lived certificates. Rowley highlighted industry advancements led by Microsoft to enhance requirements for code signing certificates and software publishing houses storing and using private keys.
        </p>,<p>
            Blue Coat Systems Senior Principal Security Architect Tammy Green spoke of recent misuses of cryptography and the need for better understanding and implementation by administrators, stating that most of the recent issues have not been with the algorithms themselves but rather with poor implementation. Green highlighted the need to ensure entropy.
        </p>,<p>
            Rackspace Security Intrapreneur Jarret Raim spoke about increasing the use of encryption in the cloud. Meanwhile, OpenDNS Director of Security Engineering Tom Hash and Technical Manager of Site Reliability Engineering for Adobe Eric Stevenson spoke about using digital certificates in a way that protects, and even advances, operational excellence within dynamic content serving environments.
        </p>,<p>
            Enterprises are not left alone to be the experts in deploying these critical technologies. DigiCert helps simplify large-scale management of digital certificates across the enterprise, and ensures strong authentication and encryption for the IoT. Smart, automated certificate management solutions can help fill these gaps.
        </p>,<p>
            ""Express, automated installation and real-time certificate monitoring and inspection provide organizations the scalabilities, efficiencies and real-time insights into their systems that make strong security of devices and data in motion feasible,"" said DigiCert's Sabin. ""Leading organizations know that device authentication and data encryption are must-haves for the IoT era, and we have the platforms and expertise they are seeking to ensure consumer trust and secure the investments they are making for the future.""
